blinked in the dark, immobilized, imprisoned in a

web, about to be devoured by a hairy insect covered
with eyes. At last he managed to stretch his hand toward the
bedside table where he kept the revolver and the loaded submachine gun. But instead of a weapon he grasped the alarm
clock: ten to four. He exhaled. Now, at last, he was fully
awake. Nightmares again? He still had a few minutes: he was
obsessive about punctuality and did not get out of bed before
four o’clock. Not a minute before, not a minute after.

“I owe everything I am to discipline,” he thought. And discipline, the polestar of his life, he owed to the Marines. He
closed his eyes. The entrance tests at San Pedro de Macoris for
the Dominican National Police, a force the Yankees decided to
create in the third year of the occupation, were very hard. He
passed with no difficulty. During training, half of the candidates were eliminated. He relished every exercise demanding
agility, boldness, audacity, or stamina, even the brutal ones that
tested your will, your obedience to a superior, plunging into
mudholes with a full field pack or surviving in the wild, drinking your own urine and chewing on stalks, weeds, grasshoppers. Sergeant Gittleman gave him the highest rating: “You'll
go far, Trujillo.” And he had, thanks to the merciless discipline
of heroes and mystics taught to him by the Marines. He
thought with gratitude of Sergeant Simon Gittleman. A loyal,
disinterested gringo in a country of hagglers, bloodsuckers, and
assholes. Had the United States had a more sincere friend than
Trujillo in the past thirty-one years? What government had
given them greater support in the UN? Which was the first to
declare war on Germany and Japan? Who gave the biggest

16

“3 He woke, paralyzed by a sense of catastrophe. He
bribes to representatives, senators, governors, mayors,
lawyers, and reporters in the United States? His reward:
economic sanctions by the OAS to make that nigger R6mulo
Betancourt happy, to keep sucking at the tit of Venezuelan oil.
If Johnny Abbes had handled things better and the bomb had
blown off the head of that faggot Rémulo, there wouldn’t be
any sanctions and the asshole gringos wouldn’t be handing
him bullshit about sovereignty, democracy, and human rights.
But then he wouldn’t have discovered that in a country of two
hundred million assholes, he had a friend like Simon Gittleman. Capable of initiating a personal campaign in defense of
the Dominican Republic from Phoenix, Arizona, where he
had been in business since his retirement from the Marines.
And not asking for a cent! There still were men like that in the
Marines. Not asking, not charging for anything! What a lesson
for those leeches in the Senate and the House of Representatives he’d been feeding for years; they always wanted more
checks, more concessions, more decrees, more tax exemptions,
and now, when he needed them, they pretended they didn’t
know him.

He looked at the clock: four minutes to go. A magnificent
gringo, that Simon Gittleman! A real Marine. Indignant at the
offensive against Trujillo by the White House, Venezuela, and
the OAS, he gave up his business in Arizona and bombarded
the American press with letters, reminding everyone that during all of the Trujillo Era the Dominican Republic had been a
bulwark of anti-Communism, the best ally of the United States
in the Western Hemisphere. Not satisfied with that, he
funded—out of his own damn pocket! —support committees,
paid for publications, organized conferences. And to set an example, he came to Ciudad Trujillo with his family and rented a
house on the Malecén. This afternoon Simon and Dorothy
would have lunch with him in the Palace, and the ex-Marine
would receive the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit, the highest decoration the Dominican Republic could bestow. A real
Marine, yes sir!

17
Four sharp, now it was time. He turned on the lamp on
the night table, put on his slippers, and got up, without the old
agility. His bones ached and he felt pains in his leg and back
muscles, the way he had a few days ago at Mahogany House,
on that damn night with that anemic little bitch. He ground
his teeth in annoyance. He was walking to the chair where Sinforoso had laid out his sweat suit and gym shoes when a suspicion stopped him cold. Anxiously he inspected the sheets: the
ugly grayish stain befouled the whiteness of the linen. It had
leaked out, again. Indignation erased the unpleasant memory
of Mahogany House. Damn it! Damn it! This wasn’t an enemy
he could defeat like the hundreds, the thousands he had confronted and conquered over the years, buying them, intimidating them, killing them. This lived inside him, flesh of his flesh,
blood of his blood. It was destroying him at precisely the time
he needed to be stronger and healthier than ever. That skinny
little cunt had brought him bad luck.

He found his jockstrap, shorts, and undershirt, immaculately washed and ironed, along with his exercise shoes. He
dressed with great effort. He never had needed much sleep:
when he was a young man in San Cristdbal, when he was the
head of the rural guards on the Boca Chica sugar plantation,
four or five hours had been enough, even if he had been drinking and fucking till dawn. His ability to recover physically with
a minimum of sleep contributed to his aura of superiority. Not
anymore. He woke exhausted and couldn’t sleep for even four
hours; two or three at the most, and those plagued by nightmares.

The night before, he lay sleepless, in the dark. Through the
window he could see the tops of trees and a piece of sky studded with stars. From time to time, in the clear night, he heard
the chatter of those old biddies, night owls declaming poems
by Juan de Dios Peza, Amado Nervo, Rubén Dario (which
made him suspect that among them was the Walking Turd,
who knew Dario by heart), Pablo Neruda’s Twenty Poems of
Love, and the risqué stanzas of Juan Antonio Alix. And, of

18
course, the verses of Dofia Maria, the Dominican writer and
moralist. He laughed aloud as he climbed on the stationary
bike and began to pedal. His wife had ended up taking herself
seriously, and periodically would organize literary evenings in
the skating rink at Radhamés Manor and bring in actresses to
recite dumb-ass poems. Senator Henry Chirinos, who passed
himself off as a poet, would participate in these soirees, feeding
his cirrhosis at public expense. To ingratiate themselves with
Maria Martinez, those bitches, just like Chirinos himself, had
memorized entire pages of her Moral Meditations or speeches
from her theater piece, False Amity. They recited them, and
then the biddies applauded. And his wife—for that fat, stupid
old woman, the Bountiful First Lady, was his wife—had taken
the business about being a writer and moralist seriously. And
why not? Didn’t the newspapers, the radio, the television say
so? Wasn’t Moral Meditations, with a prologue by the Mexican
José Vasconcelos, required reading in the schools, and wasn’t it
reprinted every two months? Hadn’t False Amity been the
greatest stage hit in the thirty-one years of the Trujillo Era?
Hadn’t the critics and reporters, the university professors,
priests, and intellectuals, praised her to the skies? Didn’t they
devote a seminar to her at the Trujillonian Institute? Hadn’t
her concepts been acclaimed by the bishops, those traitorous
crows, those Judases, who after living out of his wallet were
talking now, just like the Yankees, about human rights? The
Bountiful First Lady was a writer and a moralist. No thanks to
her, but to him, like everything else that had happened in this
country for the past three decades. Trujillo could turn water
into wine and multiply loaves of bread if he fucking well felt
like it. He reminded Maria of this during their last argument:
“You forget you didn’t write that shit, you can’t even write
your name without making grammatical mistakes, it was that
Galician traitor José Almoina, paid by me. Don’t you know
what people say? That the first letters of False Amity, F and A,
stand for Find Almoina.” He laughed again, open, joyful
laughter. His bitterness had vanished. Maria burst into tears—

19
“How you humiliate me!”—and threatened to complain to
Mama Julia. As if his poor ninety-six-year-old mother was in
any shape for family arguments. Like his own brothers and sisters, his wife was always running to the Sublime Matriarch to
cry on her shoulder. To make peace, he’d had to cross her palm
again. What Dominicans whispered was true: the writer and
moralist was a grasping, avaricious soul. And had been from
the time they were lovers. When she was still a girl she’d
thought of setting up a special laundry for the uniforms of the
Dominican National Police, and made her first money.

Pedaling warmed his body. He felt in shape. Fifteen minutes: enough. Another fifteen of rowing before he began the
day’s battle. |

The rowing machine was in a small adjoining room filled
with exercise equipment. He had begun rowing, and then a
horse’s whinny vibrated in the silence of dawn, long and musical, like a joyful paean to life. How long since he’d ndden:?
Months. He had never tired of it, after fifty years it still excited
him, like his first sip of Carlos I Spanish brandy or his first
sight of the naked, white, voluptuous body of a woman he desired. But this thought was poisoned by the memory of the
skinny little thing that son of a bitch had managed to get into
his bed. Did he do it knowing he would be shamed? No, he
didn’t have the balls for that. She probably told him about it
and gave him a good laugh. It must be making the rounds now
of all the gossipmongers in the coffee shops along El Conde.
He trembled with mortification and rage as he rowed in a
steady rhythm. He was sweating now. If they could see him!
Another myth they repeated about him was: “Trujillo never
sweats. In the worst heat of summer he puts on those woolen
uniforms, with a velvet three-cornered hat and gloves, and you
never see a drop of sweat on his forehead.” He didn’t sweat if
he didn’t want to. But when he was alone, when he was doing
his exercises, he gave permission to his body to perspire. Recently, during this difficult time, with so many problems, he
had denied himself his horses. Maybe this week he’d go to San

20
Cristobal. He’d ride alone, under the trees, along the river, like
in the old days, and feel rejuvenated. “Not even a woman’s
arms are as affectionate as the back of a chestnut.”

He stopped rowing when he felt a cramp in his left arm. He
wiped his face and looked down at his pants, at his fly. Nothing. It was still dark outside. The trees and shrubs in the gardens of Radhamés Manor were inky stains under a clear sky
crowded with twinkling lights. What was that line of Neruda’s
that the moralist’s babbling friends liked so much? “And stars
tremble blue in the distance.” Those old women trembled when
they dreamed that some poet would scratch their itch. And all
they had near at hand was Chirinos, that Frankenstein. Again
he laughed out loud, something that did not happen very often
these days.

He undressed and, wearing slippers and a robe, went to
the bathroom to shave. He turned on the radio. They read the
newspapers on the Dominican Voice and Caribbean Radio.
Until a few years ago the news bulletins had begun at five. But
when his brother Petan, the owner of the Dominican Voice,
found out that he woke at four, he moved the newscasts up an
hour. The other stations followed suit. They knew he listened
to the radio while he shaved, bathed, and dressed, and they
were painstakingly careful.

The Dominican Voice, after a jingle for El Conde Hotel
Restaurant announcing a night of dancing to Los Colosos del
Ritmo under the direction of Maestro Gatén and featuring the
singer Johnny Ventura, highlighted the Julia Molina Widow of
Trujillo Prize to the Most Prolific Mother. The winner, Dofia
Alejandrina Francisco, who had twenty-one living children, declared when she received the medal with the portrait of the
Sublime Matriarch: “My twenty-one children will give their
lives for the Benefactor if they are asked to.”

“I don’t believe you, bitch.”

He had brushed his teeth and now he was shaving as
meticulously as he always had, ever since he was a kid in a
shantytown in San Cristébal. Back when he didn’t even know

21
if his poor mother, to whom the entire country now paid
homage on Mother's Day (“A wellspring of loving-kindness
and mother of the preeminent man who governs us,” said the
announcer), would have beans and rice that night to feed the
eight mouths in her family. Cleanliness, caring for his body
and his clothing, had been, for him, the only religion he practiced faithfully.

After another long list of visitors to the home of Mama Julia,
to whom they would pay their respects on Mother's Day (poor
old woman, serenely receiving a caravan of schools, associations, institutes, unions, and thanking them in her faint little
voice for their flowers and courtesy), the attacks began on
Bishops Reilly and Panal, “who neither were born under our
sun nor suffered under our moon” (“Nice,” he thought), “and
who meddle in our civil and political life, overstepping the
bounds into the terrain of the criminal.” Johnny Abbes wanted
to go into Santo Domingo Academy and drag the Yankee
bishop out of his refuge. “What can happen, Chief? The gringos will protest, naturally. Haven’t they protested everything
for a long time now? Galindez, Murphy the pilot, the Mirabal
sisters, the attempt on Betancourt, and a thousand other
things. It doesn’t matter if the dogs bark in Caracas, Puerto
Rico, Washington, New York, Havana. What happens here is
what matters. The crows in their cassocks won’t stop conspiring until they’ve been scared out of it.” No. It wasn’t time yet
to settle the score with Reilly or that other son of a bitch, that
shitty little Spaniard Bishop Panal. The time would come, they
would pay. His instincts never deceived him. For now he
wouldn’t touch a hair on their heads, even if they kept fucking
with him, like they’d been doing since Sunday, January 24,
1960—a year and a half already! —when the Bishops’ Pastoral
Letter was read at every Mass, inaugurating the campaign of
the Catholic Church against the regime. Backbiters! Crows!
Eunuchs! Doing that to him, a man who had been decorated
in the Vatican by Pius XII with the Great Cross of the Papal
Order of St. Gregory. On the Dominican Voice, Patino

22
Pichardo, in a speech delivered the night before in his capacity
as Minister of the Interior and Religious Practice, recalled that
the state had spent sixty million pesos on the Church, whose
“bishops and priests are now doing so much harm to the
Catholic faithful of the Dominican Republic.” He turned the
dial. On Caribbean Radio they were reading a letter of protest
from hundreds of workers because their signatures had not
been included on the Great National Manifesto “against the
disturbing machinations of Bishop Thomas Reilly, a traitor to
God, Trujillo, and his own manhood, who, instead of remaining in his diocese of San Juan de la Maguana, ran like a scared
rat to hide in Ciudad Trujillo behind the skirts of American
nuns at Santo Domingo Academy, a vipers’ nest of terrorism
and conspiracy.” When he heard that the Ministry of Education had deprived Santo Domingo Academy of its accreditation because “the foreign nuns were in collusion with the
terrorist plotting of the Bishops of San Juan de la Maguana
and La Vega against the State,” he turned back to the Dominican Voice in time to hear the announcer report another victory
for the Dominican polo team in Paris, where, “on the beautiful
field of Bagatelle, after defeating the Leopards five to four and
dazzling the assembled connoisseurs, it was awarded the Aperture Cup.” Ramfis and Radhamés, the most applauded players.
A lie, to beguile Dominicans. And him. In the pit of his stomach he felt the rush of acid that attacked every time he thought
about his sons, those successful failures, those disappointments. Playing polo in Paris and fucking French girls while
their father was fighting the battle of his life!

He dried his face. His blood turned to vinegar whenever
he thought of his sons. By God, it wasn’t his fault. His line was
healthy, he was a sire of thoroughbreds. The proof was there,
in the children his seed had created in other wombs, in the
belly of Lina Lovatén, for instance: robust, energetic men, a
thousand times more deserving of the place occupied by those
two drones, a pair of nonentities named after characters in an
opera. Why had he allowed the Bountiful First Lady to give his

23
sons names out of Aida, that damn opera she saw in New
York? Those names had brought them bad luck, turned them
into operetta buffoons instead of real men. Bums, idlers without character or ambition, all they were good for was getting
drunk. They took after his brothers, not him; they were as useless as Blacky, Petén, Peepee, Anfbal, that collection of crooks,
parasites, derelicts, and losers. None of them had a millionth of
his energy, his will, his vision. What would happen to this
country when he died? He was sure Ramfis wasn’t even as
good in bed as all the asslickers said he was. So he fucked Kim
Novak! He fucked Zsa Zsa Gabor! He stuck it to Debra Paget
and half the actresses in Hollywood! Big deal. If he gave them
Mercedes-Benzes, Cadillacs, mink coats, even Crazy Valeriano
would be fucking Miss Universe and Elizabeth Taylor. Poor
Ramfis. He suspected that his son didn’t even like women very
much. He liked the appearance, he liked people to say he was
the best lover in the country, better even than Porfirio Rubirosa,
the Dominican known all over the world for the size of his
prick and his prowess as an international cocksman. Was the
Great Fucking Machine playing polo with his sons on the field
of Bagatelle? The fondness he had felt for Porfirio ever since
he’d joined his corps of military adjutants, a feeling he still had
despite the failed marriage to his oldest daughter, Flor de Oro,
improved his mood. Porfirio had ambition and he had fucked
great cunts, from the Frenchwoman Danielle Darrieux to the
multimillionaire Barbara Hutton, without giving them so
much as a bouquet of flowers; instead he squeezed them and
became rich at their expense.

He filled the tub with bath salts and bubbles and sank into
the water with the same intense satisfaction he felt every dawn.
Porfirio always led the good life. His marriage to Barbara Hutton lasted a month, the indispensable time for getting a million
dollars from her in cash and another million in property. If Ramfis or Radhamés were at least like Porfirio! That walking cock
spurted ambition. And, like every conquering hero, he had enemies. They were always coming to him with gossip, advising

24
him to get Rubirosa out of the diplomatic service because the
scandals were a stain on the national image. They were jealous.
What better propaganda for the Dominican Republic than a
cocksman like him? From the time of his marriage to Flor de
Oro, they had wanted him to tear off the head of the mulatto
fuck who’d seduced his daughter and won his admiration. He
wouldn’t do it. He knew who the traitors were, he could smell
them out before they even knew they were going to betray
him. That’s why he was still alive and so many Judases were
rotting in La Cuarenta, La Victoria, on Beata Island, in the bellies of sharks, or fattening Dominican earthworms. Poor Ramfis, poor Radhamés. Just as well that Angelita had some
character and stayed with him.

He got out of the tub and took a fast shower. The contrast
between hot and cold water revitalized him. Now he was full
of energy. As he applied deodorant and talc, he listened to
Caribbean Radio, which expressed the ideas and slogans of the
“malevolent brain,” his name for Johnny Abbes when he was
in a good mood.

There was a ranting attack on “the rat of Miraflores, that
Venezuelan scum,” and the announcer, assuming the proper
voice for talking about a faggot, stated that in addition to
starving the Venezuelan people, President Rémulo Betancourt
had brought misfortune to Venezuela, for hadn’t another plane
of Venezuelan Airlines just crashed, at a cost of sixty-two fatalities?
The fucking queer wouldn’t get his way. He had convinced the
OAS to impose sanctions, but he who laughs last laughs best.
None of them worried him—the rat of Miraflores Palace, the
Puerto Rican junkie Mufioz Marin, the Costa Rican bandit
Figueres. But the Church did. Perén had warned him, when he
left Ciudad Trujillo on his way to Spain: “Watch out for the
priests, Generalissimo, It wasn’t the fat-bellied oligarchs or the
military who brought me down; it was the crows. Make a deal
with them or get rid of them once and for all.” They weren’t
going to bring him down. What they did was fuck with him.
Starting on that black January 24 in 1960, exactly sixteen

25
months ago, they fucked with him every day. Letters, memorials, Masses, novenas, sermons. Everything those shits in cassocks said and did against him resonated overseas, where the
newspapers, radios, and televisions talked of Trujillo’s imminent fall now that “the Church had turned its back on him.”
He put on his shorts, undershirt, and socks, which Sinforoso had folded the night before and placed next to the
closet, beside the hanger with the gray suit, white shirt, and
blue tie with white flecks that he would wear this morning.
How did Bishop Reilly spend his days and nights inside Santo
Domingo Academy? Fucking the nuns? They were hideous,
some had hair on their faces. He remembered Angelita studying at that school, the one for decent people. His granddaughters too. The nuns had worshiped him until the Pastoral
Letter. Maybe Johnny Abbes was right and it was time to
act. Since the manifestos, articles, and protests on radio and
television, in various institutions, and in the Congress hadn’t
taught them a lesson, strike the blow. The people did it!
Overran the guards placed there to protect the foreign bishops, broke into Santo Domingo Academy and the bishop’s
palace in La Vega, dragged the gringo Reilly and the
Spaniard Panal out by the hair, and lynched them. Avenged
the insult to the nation. Regrets and excuses would be sent
to the Vatican, to the Holy Father John Asshole— Balaguer
was a master at writing them—and the punishment of a
handful of those responsible, chosen from among common
criminals, would be exemplary. Would the other crows learn
their lesson when they saw the bishops’ bodies drawn and
quartered by popular wrath? No, it wasn’t the right time. He
wouldn’t give Kennedy an excuse for making Betancourt,
Mufioz Marin, and Figueres happy by ordering an invasion.
Keep a cool head and proceed with caution, like a Marine.
But the dictates of reason did not convince his glands. He
had to stop dressing, blinded by a rage that flooded his entire
body, a river of lava rising to his brain, which seemed to be on
fire. He closed his eyes and counted to ten. Rage was bad for

26
the government and bad for his heart, it would give him a
coronary. The other night, in Mahogany House, it had
brought him to the verge of an attack. He began to regain his
composure. He always knew how to control his anger, when
he had to: dissimulate, pretend to be cordial and affectionate
with the worst human trash, the widows, children, brothers
and sisters of traitors, if necessary. That’s why he had been carrying the weight of a country on his shoulders for almost
thirty-two years.

He was involved in the complicated task of securing his
socks with garters so there would be no wrinkles. Now, how
pleasant it was to give free rein to his rage when there was no
risk to the State, when he could give rats, toads, hyenas, snakes
what they deserved. The bellies of sharks bore witness to the
fact that he had not denied himself the pleasure. Wasn’t the
Galician traitor José Almoina a corpse in Mexico? And the
Basque Jesus de Galindez, another serpent who bit the hand
that fed him? And Ramén Marrero Aristy, who thought that
because he was a famous author he could write articles in The
New York Times against the government that paid for his _
drunken binges, his books, his whores? And the three Mirabal
sisters who played at being Communist heroines, weren’t they
there too, proof that when he let loose the flood of his rage no
dam could contain it? Even Valeriano and Barajita, the crazy
couple on El Conde, could testify to that.

He sat holding his shoe, remembering the celebrated pair. A
real institution in the colonial city. They lived under the laurels
in Colén Park, between the arches of the cathedral, and when
they were most affluent they would appear in the doorways of
the elegant shoe shops and jewelry stores on El Conde, doing
their crazy act so that people would toss them a coin or something to eat. He had often seen Valeriano and Barajita, in their
rags and absurd adornments. When Valeriano thought he was
Christ, he would drag a cross; when he was Napoleon, he would
brandish his broomstick, bellow orders, and charge the enemy.
One of Johnny Abbes’s caliés reported that Crazy Valeriano had

27
started to make fun of the Chief, calling him the Cop. He was
curious. He went to spy on them from a car with tinted windows. The old man, his chest covered with little mirrors and
beer bottle caps, strutted around with the air of a clown, displaying his medals to a horrified crowd that did not know
whether to laugh or run away. “Applaud the Cop, you assholes,” screamed Barajita, pointing to the gleaming chest of the
madman. Then he felt the heat run through his body, blinding
him, urging him to punish their audacity. He gave the order
on the spot. But the next morning, thinking that crazy people
don’t really know what they’re saying and that instead of punishing Valeriano he ought to catch the comedians who had
told the couple what to say, on a dark dawn like this one he
told Johnny Abbes: “Crazy people are just crazy. Let them go.”
The head of the Military Intelligence Service, the SIM, grimaced: “Too late, Excellency. We threw them to the sharks
yesterday. Alive, just as you ordered.”

He stood, his shoes on his feet. A statesman does not repent
his decisions. He had never repented anything. He would
throw those two bishops to the sharks, alive. He began the
stage of his morning ritual that he performed with real delight,
recalling a novel he read when he was young, the only one he
ever thought about: Quo Vadis? A tale of Romans and Christians. He never forgot the image of the refined and wealthy
Petronius, Arbiter of elegance, who revived each morning
thanks to massages and ablutions, ointments, essences, perfumes, and his slave girls’ caresses. If he had the time, he would
do what the Arbiter did: spend the entire morning in the hands
of masseuses, pedicurists, manicurists, barbers, bathers, after
the exercises for stimulating his muscles and activating his heart.
He had a short massage at midday, after lunch, and a more
leisurely one on Sundays, when he could spare two or three
hours from his pressing obligations. But the times weren’t right
for relaxing with the sensual delights of the great Petronius. He
had to be content with the ten minutes he spent applying the
perfumed Yardley deodorant that Manuel Alfonso sent to him

28
from New York—poor Manuel, how could he go on, after his
operation? —and the gentle French moisturizing cream Bienfait
' du Matin, and the cologne, also Yardley, with the light meadow
scent, that he rubbed on his chest. When his hair was combed
and he had touched up the ends of the thin brush mustache he
had worn for twenty years, he powdered his face generously until he had hidden under a delicate whitish cloud the dark tinge
of the Haitian blacks who were his maternal ancestors, something he had always despised on other people’s skin, and on his
own.

He was dressed, with jacket and tie, at six minutes to five.
He checked this with satisfaction: he never went past the hour.
It was one of his superstitions; if he did not walk into his office
at five sharp, something bad would happen that day.

He went over to the window. It was still dark, as if it were
midnight. But he saw fewer stars than he had an hour earlier.
They were shining less bravely. Day was about to break and
soon they'd run away. He picked up a walking stick and went
to the door. As soon as he opened it, he heard the heels of the
two military adjutants.

“Good morning, Excellency.”

“Good morning, Excellency.”

He responded with a nod. At a glance he could tell that
they were dressed correctly. He did not allow slovenliness or
disorder in any officer or man in the Armed Forces, but among
the adjutants, the unit responsible for guarding him, a missing
button, a spot or wrinkle on trousers or tunic, a carelessly
placed visored cap were grave faults punishable by several days
of rigorous discipline and, at times, expulsion and a return to
the regular battalions.

A light breeze stirred the trees of Radhamés Manor as he
passed, and he heard the whisper of the leaves and, from the stable, another whinnying horse. Johnny Abbes, a report on the
progress of the campaign, a visit to San Isidro Air Base, a report
from Chirinos, lunch with the Marine, three or four audiences, a
meeting with the Minister of the Interior and Religious Practice,

29
a meeting with Balaguer, a meeting with Cucho Alvarez Pina,
president of the Dominican Party, and a walk along the
Malecon after he had visited Mama Julia. Would he sleep in
San Cristébal to take away the bad taste of the other night?

He walked into his office, in the National Palace, when his
watch said five. Breakfast was on his desk—fruit juice, buttered
toast, fresh-brewed coffee—with two cups. And, getting to his
feet, the flabby silhouette of the director of the Intelligence
Service, Colonel Johnny Abbes Garcia:

“Good morning, Excellency.”

30
