become rigid, looking at each other as if caught

in some mischief. Voices on the ground floor
and an exclamation of surprise. Hurried steps coming up the
stairs. The door opens almost at the same time that they hear
an impatient knock, and a bewildered face peers in; Urania immediately recognizes her cousin Lucinda.

“Urania? Urania?” Her large protruding eyes examine her
from top to bottom, from bottom to top, then she opens her
arms and walks toward her as if to verify whether or not she is
a hallucination. —

“It's me, Lucindita.” Urania embraces the younger daughter of her Aunt Adelina, the cousin who is her own age, her
classmate at school.

“Uranita! I can’t believe it! You’re here? Let me take a look
at you! What’s going on? Why didn’t you call me? Why didn’t
you come to the house? Have you forgotten how much we
love you? Don’t you remember your Aunt Adelina, and Manolita? And me, you ungrateful thing?”

She is so surprised, so full of questions, so curious—“My
God, girl, how could you spend thirty-five years—thirty-five,
right? —without coming home and seeing your family? Oh,
Uranita! You must have so much to tell us!”—that she doesn’t
give her time to answer her questions. That’s one way she hasn’t changed much. Even as a little girl she chattered like a parrot, Lucindita the enthusiastic one, the inventive and playful
one. The cousin she always liked best. Urania remembers her
in her dress uniform, white skirt and navy-blue jacket, and in
the everyday pink-and-blue outfit: an agile, plump little girl in
bangs, with braces on her teeth and a smile on her lips. Now

17]

 

2 OQ At the sound of the bell, Urania and her father
she is a stout matron, her face taut and smooth with no sign of
a face-lift, wearing a simple flowered dress. Her only adornment is a pair of long, flashing gold earrings. Suddenly she interrupts her affectionate questioning of Urania, goes over to
the invalid, and kisses him on the forehead.

“What a nice surprise your daughter gave you, Uncle
Agustin. You didn’t expect your little girl to come back to life
and pay you a visit. It’s a happy time, isn’t it, Uncle Agustin?”

She kisses him again on the forehead and just as abruptly
forgets about him. She sits next to Urania on the edge of the
bed. She takes her by the arm, looks at her, examines her, overwhelms her again with exclamations and questions:

“You look so good, girl. We're the same age, night? And
you look ten years younger. It’s not fair! It must be because
you never married and had children. Nothing like a husband
and kids to ruin your looks. What a figure, what skin! You
look like a kid, Urania!”

She begins to recognize in her cousin’s voice the nuances,
the accents, the music of the little girl she played with so often
in the courtyards of Santo Domingo Academy, and to whom
she so often had to explain geometry and trigonometry.

“A whole lifetime of not seeing each other, Lucindita, of
not knowing anything about each other,” she exclaims at last.

“It’s your fault, you ungrateful thing.” Her cousin lectures
her ‘with affection, but now her eyes blaze with the question,
the questions, that uncles, aunts, and cousins must have asked
one another so often in the early years, after the sudden departure of Uranita Cabral, at the end of May 1961, for the distant
town of Adrian, Michigan, where Siena Heights Preparatory
School and College had been established by the same order of
Dominican nuns that administered Santo Domingo Academy
in Ciudad Trujillo. “I never understood it, Uranita. You and I
were such good friends besides being cousins, we were so
close. What happened to make you suddenly turn away from
us? From your papa, your aunts and uncles, your cousins. Even
from me. I wrote twenty or thirty letters and not a word from

172
you. For years I sent you postcards, birthday cards, and so did
Manolita and my mama. What did we ever do to you? What
made you so angry that for thirty-five years you never wrote,
never even set foot in your own country?”

“The foolishness of youth, Lucindita.” Urania laughs and
takes her hand. “But now, as you can see, ’'m over it, and here
I am.”

“Are you sure you're not a ghost?” Her cousin pulls back
to look at her, and shakes her head in disbelief. “Why come like
this, not letting anybody know? We would have met you at the
airport.” :

“I wanted to surprise you,” Urania lies. “It was a lastminute decision. An impulse. I threw a couple of things in a
suitcase and caught a plane.”

“In the family, we were sure you’d never come back again.”
Lucinda becomes serious. “Uncle Agustin too. I have to tell
you, he suffered a lot. Because you didn’t want to talk to him,
wouldn’t answer him on the phone. He was desperate, he used
to cry about it to my mama. He never got over your treating
him like that. ’'m sorry, I don’t know why Im telling you this,
I don’t want to interfere in your life, Urania. Its because we
were always so close. Tell me about yourself. You live in New
York, right? I know things are going well for you. We've followed your career, you’re a legend in the family. You work in a
very important office, don’t you?”

“Well, there are bigger law firms than ours.”

“Tt doesn’t surprise me that you’ve been so successful in the
United States,” Lucinda exclaims, and Urania detects an acid
note in her cousin’s voice. “Everybody saw it coming from the
time you were a little girl, you were so intelligent and studious.
Mother Superior said so, and Sister Helen Claire, Sister Francis, Sister Susana, and especially Sister Mary, you were always
her pet: Uranita Cabral, an Einstein in skirts.” |

Urania bursts out laughing. Not so much because of what
her cousin says as for the way she says it: with eloquence and
humor, talking with her mouth, eyes, hands, her whole body,

173
all at the same time and with the effusive high spirits typical of
Dominican speech. Something she learned about, by way of
contrast, thirty-five years earlier, when she came to Adrian,
Michigan, and suddenly found herself surrounded by people
who spoke only English.

“When you left and didn’t even say goodbye to me, I was
so sad I almost died,” her cousin says, sorrowful about those
long-ago times. “Nobody in the family understood anything.
But what does this mean? Uranita goes to the United States
and doesn’t even: say goodbye! We pestered Uncle Agustin
with questions, but he seemed to be in the dark too. “The nuns
offered her a scholarship, it was too good an opportunity to
miss.” Nobody believed him.”

“That’s how it was, Lucindita.” Urania looks at her father,
who once again is motionless and attentive, listening to them.
“There was a chance to study in Michigan, and not being a
fool, I took it.”

“That part I understand,” her cousin reiterates, “and I
know you deserved a scholarship. But why leave as if you were
running away? Why break with your family, your father, your
country?”

“I was always a little crazy, Lucindita. And really, even
though I didn’t write, I thought about all of you a lot. Especially you.” |

A lie. You didn’t miss anyone, not even Lucinda, your
cousin and classmate, your confidante and accomplice in mischief. You wanted to forget her too, and Manolita, Aunt
Adelina, and your father, this city and this country, during
those early months in faraway Adrian, on that beautiful campus of neat gardens with their begonias, tulips, magnolia trees,
borders of rosebushes, and tall pines whose resinous scent
drifted into the room you shared during your first year with
four roommates, among them Alina, the black girl from Georgia, your first friend in that new world so different from the
one where you had spent your first fourteen years. Did the
Dominican nuns at Adrian know why you had left as if you

174
were “running away”? Did they find out from Sister Mary, the
director of studies at Santo Domingo? They had to know. If
Sister Mary hadn’t given them some background, they wouldn’t have given you the scholarship so quickly. The sisters were
models of discretion, because in the two years Urania spent at
Siena Heights Prep and the four years following at Siena
Heights College, none of them ever made the slightest allusion
to the story that tore at your memory. As for the rest, they
never repented of having been so generous: you were the first
graduate of that school to be accepted at Harvard and earn a
degree with honors from the most prestigious university in the
world. Adrian, Michigan! You haven’t been back in so many
years. It must have changed from the provincial town of farmers who went into their houses at sunset and left the streets
empty, families whose horizons ended at neighboring towns
that seemed like twins—Clinton and Chelsea—and whose
greatest diversion was attending the famous barbecued chicken
festival in Manchester. A clean city, Adrian, and pretty, especially in winter when the snow hid the straight, narrow streets
where people could ice-skate and ski, under white puffs of cotton that chiidren made into snowmen and that you, entranced,
watched falling from the sky, and where you would have died
of bitterness, and perhaps of boredom, if you hadn’t devoted
yourself so furiously to studying.

Her cousin has not stopped talking.

“And a little while after that they killed Trujillo, and the
calamities began. Do you know the calés went into the
academy? They beat the sisters, Sister Helen Claire’s face was
covered with cuts and bruises, and they killed Badulaque, the
German shepherd. They almost burned down our house because we were related to your papa. They said that Uncle
Agustin sent you to the United States because he guessed what
was going to happen.”

“Well, he wanted to get me away from here,” Urania interrupts. “Even though he had fallen into disgrace, he knew the
anti-Trujillistas would settle accounts with him.”

175
“T understand that too,” Lucinda murmurs. “But not your
refusing to have anything more to do with us.”

“And since you always had a good heart, Pll bet you’re not
still angry with me,” Urania says with a laugh. “Right, Lucindita?” |

“Of course not,” her cousin agrees. “If you knew how
much I begged my papa to send me to the United States. To
be with you, at Siena Heights. I had persuaded him, I think,
when the disaster came. Everybody began attacking us, telling
horrible lies about the family just because my mother was the
sister of a Trujillista. Nobody remembered that at the end Trujillo treated your papa like a dog. You were lucky not to be
here during those months, Uranita. We were scared to death. I
don’t know how Uncle Agustin stopped them from burning
his house. But sometimes they threw stones at him.”

She is interrupted by a timid knock at the door.

“I don’t mean to interrupt,” the nurse says, pointing at the
invalid. “But it’s time.”

Urania looks at her, not understanding.

“To do his business,” Lucinda explains, glancing at the
chamber pot. “He’s as regular as a clock. He’s so lucky: I have
problems with my stomach and live on prunes. Nerves, they
say. Well, let’s go to the living room.”

As they walk down the stairs, the memory returns to Urania of her months and years in Adrian, the austere library with
stained-glass windows, beside the chapel and adjacent to the
refectory, where she spent most of her time when she wasn’t in
classes and seminars. Studying, reading, scrawling in notebooks, writing essays, summarizing books, in the methodical,
intense, absorbed way that her teachers valued so highly and
that filled some classmates with admiration and infuriated others. It wasn’t a desire to learn and succeed that kept you in the
library but the yearning to become distracted, intoxicated, lost
in those subjects—sciences or literature, it was all the same—so
you wouldn’t think, so you could drive away your Dominican
memories.

176
“But you’re wearing gym clothes,” Lucinda observes when
they're in the living room, near the window that faces the garden. “Don’t tell me you’ve done aerobics this morning.”

“I went for a run on the Malecén. And on my way back to
the hotel, my feet brought me here, dressed in these clothes. I
arrived a couple of days ago, and wasn’t sure if ’'d come to see
him or not. If it would be too much of a shock for him. But he
hasn’t even recognized me.”

“Of course he recognized you.” Her cousin crosses her legs
and takes a pack of cigarettes and a lighter out of her purse.
“He can’t talk, but he knows who comes in, and he understands everything. Manolita and I see him almost every day.
My mama can’t, not since she broke her hip. If we miss one
day, he puts on a long face the next time.”

She sits looking at Urania in a way that makes her predict:
“Another string of reproaches.” Doesn’t it make you sad that
your father is spending his final years alone, in the hands of a
nurse, visited only by two nieces? Isn’t 1t your job to be with
him and give him affection? Do you think that giving him a
pension means you’ve done your duty? It’s all in Lucinda’s
bulging eyes. But she doesn’t dare say it. She offers Urania a
cigarette, and when her cousin refuses, she exclaims:

“You don’t smoke, of course. I thought you wouldn’t, living in the United States. They’re psychotic about tobacco up
there.”

“Yes, really psychotic,” Urania admits. “They've banned
smoking in the office. It doesn’t matter to me, I never
smoked.” |

“The perfect girl,” Lucindita says with a laugh. “Listen,
darling, you can tell me, did you ever have any vices? Did you
ever do any of those crazy things everybody else does?”

“Some.” Urania laughs. “But I can’t tell you about them.”

As she talks to her cousin, she examines the living room.
The furniture is the same, its shabbiness shows that; the armchair has a broken leg and a wedge of wood props it up; the
frayed upholstery is torn and has lost its color, which, Urania

177
recalls, was a pale brownish red. Worse than the furniture are
the walls: damp spots everywhere, and in many places parts of
the outside wall are visible. The curtains have disappeared,
though the wooden rods and rings where they hung are still
there.

“You're upset by how bad your house looks.” Her cousin
exhales a mouthful of smoke. “Ours is the same, Urania. The
family was ruined when Trujillo died, that’s the truth. They
threw my papa out of the Tobacco Company and he never
found another job. Because he was your father’s brother-inlaw, just because of that. Well, Uncle Agustin had it even
worse. They investigated him, made all kinds of accusations,
brought lawsuits against him. Even though he had fallen into
disgrace with Trujillo. They couldn’t prove anything, but his
life was ruined too. It’s lucky you’re doing well and can help
him. Nobody in the family could. We were all flat broke, on
our uppers. Poor Uncle Agustin! He wasn’t like so many others who made accommodations. He was a decent, honest man,
and that’s why he was ruined.”

Urania listens gravely, her eyes encourage Lucinda to go
on but her mind is in Michigan, at Siena Heights, reliving
those years of obsessive, redemptive study. The only letters she
read and answered were from Sister Mary. Affectionate, discreet letters that never mentioned what had happened, though
if Sister Mary had—she was the only person in whom Urania
had confided, the one who came up with the brilliant solution
of getting her out of there and sending her to Adrian, the one
who threatened Senator Cabral until he agreed—she would
not have been angry. Would it have been a relief to unburden
herself occasionally in a letter to Sister Mary, to mention the
phantom that gave her no peace?

Sister Mary wrote to her about the school, she told her
about the great events and turbulent months that followed the
assassination of Trujillo, the departure of Ramfis and the rest
of the family, the changes in government, the violence and disorder in the streets, she expressed interest in her studies and

178
congratulated her on her academic achievements.

“How is it you never got married?” Lucindita undresses
her with a look. “It couldn’t be for lack of opportunity. You
still look good. Pm sorry, but you know, Dominican women
are very nosy.”

“T really don’t know why,” Urania says with a shrug.
“Maybe I didn’t have the time, Lucinda. [ve always been too
busy; first studying, then working. Pm used to living alone and
couldn’t share my life with a man.”

She hears herself talking and can’t believe what she’s saying. Lucinda, on the other hand, doesn’t doubt what she hears.

“Girl, you did the right thing.” She grows sad. “You tell
me what good it did me to get married. Pedro, that bum, left
me with two little girls. One day he moved out and never sent
a penny. I’ve had to raise two girls doing the most boring
things: renting houses, selling flowers, giving classes to drivers,
and they’re really fresh, you have no idea. I never studied for
anything, it was the only work I could find. I wish I were like
you, Uranita. You have a profession and earn a living in the
capital of the world, you have an interesting job. You’re better
off not being married. But you must have had your share of
affairs, right?”

Urania feels her cheeks burning, and her blush makes Lucinda laugh:

“Aha, aha, look at you. You have a lover! Tell me about
him. Is he rich? Good-looking? Gringo or Latino?”

“A gentleman with graying temples, very elegant,” Urania
improvises. “Married, with children. We see each other on
weekends, if ’'m not traveling. A nice relationship, with no
commitments.”

“Girl, Pm so jealous!” Lucinda claps her hands. “Its my
dream. An old man who’s rich and distinguished. ll have to
go to New York to find one, here all the old men are disasters:
fat as pigs and dead broke.”

In Adrian she couldn’t avoid attending some parties, going
out with boys and girls, pretending to flirt with some freckled

179
farmer’ son who talked about horses or dangerous climbs up
snow-covered mountains in winter, but she would return to
the dormitory so exhausted by all the pretending she had to do
that she looked for reasons to avoid diversion. She developed a
repertory of excuses: exams, projects, visits, ailments, pressing
deadlines for turning in papers. During her years at Harvard,
she didn’t recall ever going to a party, or a bar, or dancing, not
even once.

“Manolita had terrible luck in her marriage too. Not because her husband was a womanizer, like mine. Esteban
wouldn’t harm a fly. But he’s useless, he loses every job he gets.
Now he’s working at one of the tourist hotels they built in
Punta Canas. He earns a miserable salary, and my sister sees
him maybe once or twice a month. Is that what you call a marriage?”

“Do you remember Rosalia Perdomo?” Urania interrupts.

“Rosalia Perdomo?” Lucinda searches her memory, half
closing her eyes. “The truth is, I don’t . . . Oh, sure! The Rosalia who had that trouble with Ramfis Trujillo? Nobody ever
saw her again. They must have sent her overseas.”

Urania’s admission to Harvard Law School was celebrated
at Siena Heights as a great event. Until she had been accepted,
she hadn’t realized how much prestige the university had in the
United States, how reverently everyone referred to those who
had graduated, studied, or taught there. It happened in the
most natural way; if she had planned it, it couldn’t have been
easier. She was in her last year. The guidance counselor, after
congratulating her on her academic work; asked what professional plans she had, and Urania replied, “I like the law.” “A
career where you can earn a lot of money,” Dr. Dorothy Sallison responded. But Urania had said “law” because it was the
first thing that came to mind, she could have just as easily said
medicine, economics, or biology. You had never thought
about your future, Urania; you were so paralyzed by the past it
never occurred to you to think about what lay ahead. Dr. Sallison reviewed various options with her and they chose four

180
prestigious universities: Yale, Notre Dame, Chicago, and Stanford. One or two days after completing the applications, Dr.
Sallison called her: “Why not Harvard too? You have nothing
to lose.” Urania remembers traveling to interviews, the nights
in religious hostels, arranged for by the Dominican sisters. And
the joy of Dr. Sallison, the nuns, and her classmates as she received acceptances from all the universities, including Harvard.
They gave her a party, where she was obliged to dance.

Her six years in Adrian allowed her to survive, something
she thought she would never be able to do. Which is why she
was still profoundly grateful to the Dominican sisters. And yet
Adrian, in her memory, was a somnambulistic, uncertain time,
the only concrete thing the infinite hours in the library, when
she worked to keep from thinking.

Cambridge, Massachusetts, was different. There she began
to live again, to discover that life was worth living, that studying was not only therapy but a joy, the most glorious of diversions. How she had relished the classes, the lectures, the
seminars! Overwhelmed by the abundance of possibilities (in
addition to studying law, she audited a course in Latin American history, a seminar on the Caribbean, a series on Dominican
social history), she found there were not enough hours in the
day or weeks in the month to do everything that appealed to
her.

Years of intensive work, and not only intellectual. In her
second year at Harvard, her father let her know, in one of those
letters she never answered, that in view of how badly things
were going, he found himself obliged to cut the five hundred
dollars a month he was sending her down to two hundred. She
obtained a student loan, and her studies were assured. But to
meet her frugal needs, in her free hours she worked as a cashier
at a supermarket, a waitress at a Boston _ pizzeria,
a clerk at a pharmacy, and—her least tedious job—as a companion and reader to a paraplegic millionaire of Polish origin,
Mr. Melvin Makovsky, to whom, from five to eight in the
evening, in his Victorian brownstone house on Massachusetts

181
Avenue, she read voluminous eighteenth- and nineteenthcentury novels (War and Peace, Moby Dick, Bleak House,
Pamela) and who, after she had been his reader for three
months, unexpectedly proposed marriage.

“A paraplegic?” Lucinda’s large eyes open wide.

“Seventy years old,” Urania says. “And very rich. He proposed marriage, that’s right. So I could keep him company and
read to him, that’s all.”

“You were a fool, Urania.” Lucindita was scandalized.
“You would have inherited a fortune, you’d be a millionaire.”

“Youre right, it would have been a terrific deal.”

“But you were young, idealistic, and you believed a girl
should marry for love.” Her cousin makes her explanations
easy. “As if any of that lasts. I missed a chance too, with a doctor who was rolling in money. He was crazy about me. But he
was dark-skinned, they said his mother was Haitian. Pm not
prejudiced, but suppose my child was a throwback and came
out black as coal?”

She liked studying so much, she felt so happy at Harvard,
that she planned to complete a Ph.D. and go into teaching. But
she didn’t have the money. Her father was in an increasingly
difficult situation, in her third year he cut off her already reduced monthly allowance, and she needed to get a degree and
begin earning money as soon as she could to pay off her student loans and support herself. The prestige of Harvard Law
School was immense; when she began to send out applications, she was called to a good number of interviews. She decided on the World Bank. She was sorry to leave; during her
years in Cambridge, she acquired her “perverse hobby”: reading and collecting books on the Trujillo Era.

In the shabby living room there is another photograph of
her graduation—a morning of brilliant sun that lit up the Yard,
festive with canopies, elegant clothing, the many-colored mortarboards and robes of professors and graduates—identical to
the one that Senator Cabral has in his bedroom. How did he
get it? She certainly didn’t send it to him. Of course, Sister

182
Mary. She’d sent this photograph to Santo Domingo
Academy. For, until the nun’s death, Urania maintained a correspondence with her. That charitable soul must have kept
Senator Cabral informed about Urania’s life. She remembers
Sister Mary looking at the sea, leaning against the stone
balustrade on the top floor of the academy building facing
southeast — off-limits to students, it was where the nuns lived;
at that distance, from the courtyard where the two German
shepherds, Badulaque and Brutus, raced around the tennis
courts, the volleyball courts, and the swimming pool, her lean
silhouette seemed smaller.

It’s hot, and she drips perspiration. She has never felt anything like this volcanic heat even in steamy New York summers, which are offset by the chill of air conditioning. This was
a different kind of heat: the heat of her childhood. And she had
never heard that extravagant symphony of blowing horns,
voices, music, barking, squealing brakes, which came in
through the windows and obliged her and her cousin to raise
their voices.

“Ts it true that Johnny Abbes put Papa in prison when they
killed Trujillo?”

“Didn’t he tell you about it?” her cousin asks in surprise.

“T was already in Michigan,” Urania reminds her.

Lucinda nods, with an apologetic half-smile.

“Of course he did. Those men went crazy. Ramfis, Radhameés, the Trujillistas. They began killing and locking up people
left and right. Well, I really don’t remember much about it.I was
a little girl and didn’t care anything about politics. Uncle Agustin
had been distanced from Trujillo, and they must have thought he
was involved in the plot. They held him in that awful prison, La
Cuarenta, the one that Balaguer tore down, there’s a church there
now. My mama went to talk to Balaguer, to plead with him.
They kept him locked up for a few days until they proved he wasn’t part of the conspiracy. Later, the President gave him a miserable little job that seemed like a joke: as an official in the Civil
Government of the Third District.”

183
“Did he say anything about how he was treated in La
Cuarenta?”

Lucinda exhales smoke that hides her face for a moment.

“Maybe to my parents, but not to me or Manolita, we
were very. young. It hurt Uncle Agustin that they thought he
could have betrayed Trujillo. For years he protested the injustice that had been done to him.”

“The Generalissimo’s most loyal servant,” mocks Urania.
“For a man capable of committing monstrous crimes for
Trujillo to be suspected of complicity with his assassins—
that really was an injustice!”

She stops because of the reproach she sees on her cousin’s
round face.

“I don’t know why you talk about monstrous crimes,” she
murmurs in astonishment. “Maybe my uncle was wrong to be
a Trujillista. Now they say he was a dictator and all. Your. father served him in good faith. Even though he held such high
posts, he didn’t take advantage of them. Did he? He’s spending
his final years as poor as a dog; without you, he’d be in an oldage home.”

Lucinda tries to control the imitation that has overwhelmed her. She takes a final drag on her cigarette, and since
she has no place to put it out—there are no ashtrays in the dilapidated living room—she tosses it out the window into the
withered garden.

“I know very well that my papa didn’t serve Trujillo out of
self-interest.” Urania cannot avoid a trace of sarcasm. “That
doesn’t seem extenuating to me. It’s more like an aggravating
circumstance.”

Her cousin looks at her, uncomprehending..

“The fact that he did what he did out of admiration, out of
love for him,” Urania explains. “Of course he must have been
offended when Ramfis, Abbes Garcia, and the rest suspected
him. He almost went mad with despair when Trujillo turned
his back on him.”

“Well, maybe he was wrong,” her cousin repeats, her eyes

184
begging her to change the subject. “At least recognize that he
was a very decent man. He didn’t make accommodations, like
so many others, who went on living the good life with every
government, especially the three run by Balaguer.”

“I wish he had served Trujillo out of self-interest, to steal
or have power,” Urania says, and again she sees perplexity and
displeasure in Lucinda’s eyes. “Anything, rather than seeing
him whimper because Trujillo wouldn’t grant him an audience,
because letters appeared in ‘The Public Forum” insulting him.”

It is a persistent memory, one that tormented her in Adrian
and in Cambridge, in somewhat attenuated form stayed with
her through all her years at the World Bank in Washington,
D.C., and that still assaults her in Manhattan: the helpless Senator Agustin Cabral pacing frantically in this very living room,
asking himself what intrigue had been mounted against him by
the Constitutional Sot, the unctuous Joaquin Balaguer, the
cynical Virgilio Alvarez Pina, or Pafno Pichardo, to make the
Generalissimo wipe out his existence overnight. Because what
existence could a senator and ex-minister have when the Benefactor did not answer his letters or permit him to appear in
Congress? Was the history of Anselmo Paulino repeating itself
in him? Would the cals come for him in the middle of the
night and bury him in some dungeon? Would La Nacion and
El Caribe come out with vile reports of his thefts, embezzlements, betrayals, crimes?

“Falling into disgrace was worse for him than if they had
killed the person he loved best.”

Her cousin listens to her with increasing discomfort.

“Was that why you got so angry, Uranita?” she says at last.
“Over politics? But I remember very clearly that you had no interest at all in politics. When those two girls nobody knew
came in at midyear, for example. Everybody said they were
caltesas and nobody talked about anything else, but you were
bored by political gossip and told us all to shut up.”

_ “Pye never been interested in politics,” Urania agrees.
“You're nght, why talk about things that happened thirty years

185
ago?”

The nurse appears on the stairs. She comes down drying
her hands on a blue cloth.

“All cleaned up and powdered like a baby,” she announces.
“You can go up whenever you want. I’m going to prepare Don
Agustin’s lunch. Can I fix something for you too, sefiora?”

“No, thank you,” says Urania. “P'm going back to the hotel
to shower and change.”

“Well, tonight you'll come to the house for supper. You'll
give my mama such a nice surprise. P'll call Manolita too, she'll
be so happy.” Lucinda puts on a mournful face. “Yourll be
shocked, Uranita. Do you remember how big and pretty the
house was? Only half of it is left. When Papa died, we had to
sell the garden along with the garage and the servants’ quarters.
Well, enough of that. Seeing you has made me remember my
childhood. We were happy then, weren’t we? It never occurred
to us that everything would change, that lean years would
come. Well, ’'m going, Mama hasn’t had her lunch yet. You'll
come for supper, won’t you? You won’t disappear for another
thirty-five years? You must remember the house, on Calle Santiago, about five blocks from here.”

“I remember it very well.” Urania stands and embraces her
cousin. “This neighborhood hasn’t changed at all.”

She accompanies Lucinda to the front door and says goodbye with another hug and a kiss on the cheek. When she sees
her walking away in her flowered dress, along a street boiling
in the sun, where the response to frantic barking is the cackling
of hens, she is filled with anguish. What are you doing here?
What have you come to find in Santo Domingo, in this house?
Will you go to have supper with Lucinda, Manolita, and Aunt
Adelina? The poor thing must be a fossil, just like your father.

She climbs the stairs, slowly, putting off seeing him again.
She is relieved to find him asleep, huddled in his chair; his eyes
are wrinkled, his mouth open, and his rachitic chest rises and
falls in a rhythmic pattern. “Just a piece of a man.” She sits on
the bed and contemplates him. Studies him, reads him. They

186
imprisoned him too, when Trujillo died. Believing he was one
of the Trujillistas who conspired with Antonio de la Maza,
General Juan Tomas Diaz and his brother Modesto, Antonio
Imbert, and company. How frightening and how frightful for
you, Papa. She had learned many years later, in a passing reference in an article about the events of 1961 in the Dominican
Republic, that her father had also been caught in the dragnet.
But she never knew the details. As far as she could remember,
Senator Cabral did not allude to the experience in the letters
she never answered. “That anyone could imagine, even for a
second, that you planned to assassinate Trujillo, must have
hurt you as much as falling into disgrace without knowing
why.” Did Johnny Abbes himself interrogate him? Ramfis? Pechito Ledn Estévez? Did they sit him on the Throne? Was her
father linked in some way to the conspirators? True, he had
made superhuman efforts to regain Trujillo’s favor, but what
did that prove? Many conspirators kissed Trujillo’s ass until
moments before they killed him. It very well might be that
Agustin Cabral, a good friend of Modesto Diaz, had been informed of the plan. Even Balaguer knew about it, according to
some. If the President of the Republic and the Minister of the
Armed Forces had heard about it, why not her father? The
conspirators knew that the Chief had ordered the fall from
grace of Senator Cabral several weeks earlier; nothing strange
about their thinking of him as a possible ally.

From time to time her father emits a quiet snore. When a
fly settles on his face, he drives it away, not waking, with a
movement of his head. How did you find out they had killed
him? On May 30, 1961, you were already in Adrian. She was
beginning to shake off the heaviness, the exhaustion that kept
her disengaged from the world and from herself, in a kind of
somnambulism, when the sister in charge of the dormitory
came to the room that Urania shared with four other girls and
showed her the headline in the newspaper she held in her
hand: TRUJILLO KILLED. “Tl lend it to you,” she said. What did
you feel? She would swear she felt nothing, that the news slid

187
over her without piercing her consciousness, like everything
else she heard and saw around her. It’s possible you didn’t even
read the article, didn’t look past the headline. She recalls, however, that days or weeks later, in a letter from Sister Mary,
there were details about the crime, about the caliés breaking
into the academy to take away Bishop Reilly, about the lawlessness and uncertainty they were living through. But not
even that letter from Sister Mary could pull her out of the profound indifference to everything and everyone Dominican into
which she had fallen and from which she was freed only years
later, by a course on Antillean history at Harvard.

This sudden decision to come to Santo Domingo, to visit
your father, does it mean you’re cured? No. You must have felt
happy, been moved, at seeing Lucinda again, she was so close
to you, your companion in rounds of vermouth, and at the
matinees at the Olimpia and Elite movie theaters, on the beach
or at the Country Club, and you must have felt sorry for the
apparent mediocrity of her life, her lack of hope that 1t would
improve. No. She didn’t make you happy, she didn’t move
you, she didn’t make you feel sorry. She bored you because of
that sentimentality and self-pity you find so objectionable.

“You're an iceberg. You really don’t seem Dominican. ’m
more Dominican than you are.” Well, well; imagine remembering Steve Duncan, her colleague at the World Bank. 1985
or 1986? Around then. They had been in Taipei that night,
having supper together in the Grand Hotel, shaped like a Hollywood pagoda, where they were staying; through its windows
the city looked like a blanket of fireflies. For the third, fourth,
or tenth time, Steve proposed marriage and Urania, more categorically than before, told him no. Then, in surprise, she saw
Steve’s ruddy face contort. She couldn’t contain her laughter.

“Don’t tell me you’re going to cry, Steve. For love of me?
Or have you had too much whiskey?”

Steve did not smile. He sat looking at her for a long time,
without answering, and then he said those words: “You're an
iceberg. You really don’t seem Dominican. ’m more Dominican

188
than you are.” Well, well; the redhead fell in love with you,
Urania. Whatever happened to him? A wonderful person, with
a degree in economics from the University of Chicago, his interest in the Third World encompassed its problems of development, its languages, and its women. He finally married a
Pakistani, an official of the Bank in the area of communications.

Are you an iceberg, Urania? Only with men. And not with
all of them. With those whose glances, movements, gestures,
tones of voice announce a danger. When you can read, in their
minds or instincts, the intention to court you, to make advances. With them, yes, you do make them feel the arctic cold
that you know how to project around you, like the stink
skunks use to frighten away an enemy. A technique you handle
with the mastery you’ve brought to every goal you set for
yourself: studies, work, an independent life. “Everything except being happy.” Would she have been happy if, applying her
will, her discipline, she had eventually overcome the uncon- —
querable revulsion and disgust caused by men who desired
her? You could have gone into therapy, seen a psychologist, an
analyst. They had a remedy for everything, even finding men
repugnant. But you never wanted to be cured. On the contrary, you don’t consider it a disease but a character trait, like
your intelligence, your solitude, your passion for doing good
work.

Her father’s eyes are open, and he looks at her with a certain fear.

“I was thinking about Steve, a Canadian at the World
Bank,” she says in a quiet voice, scrutinizing him. “Since I didn’t
want to marry him, he told me I was an iceberg. An accusation
that would offend any Dominican woman. We have a reputation
for being ardent, unbeatable in love. I earned a reputation for
being just the opposite: prudish, indifferent, frigid. What do you
think of that, Papa? Just now, for my cousin Lucinda, I had to
invent a lover so she wouldn’t think badly of me.”

She falls silent because she notices that the invalid, shrinking in his chair, seems terrified. He no longer shakes off the

189
flies that walk undisturbed across his face.

“A subject I would have liked us to talk about, Papa.
Women, sex. Did you have affairs after Mama died? I never
noticed anything. You didn’t seem like a womanizer. Did
power satisfy you so much you didn’t need sex? It happens,
even in this hot country. It happened to our perpetual President, Don Joaquin Balaguer, didn’t it? A bachelor at the age of
_ ninety. He wrote love poems, and there are rumors he had a
daughter he never recognized. I always had the impression that
sex never interested him, that power gave him what other men
got in bed. Was that the case with you, Papa? Or did you have
discreet adventures? Did Trujillo invite you to his orgies at
Mahogany House? What happened there? Did the Chief, like
Ramfis, amuse himself by humiliating his friends and courtiers,
forcing them to shave their legs, shave their bodies, make
themselves up like old queens? Did he do those charming
things too? Did he do them to you?”

Senator Cabral has turned so pale that Urania thinks:
“He’s going to faint.” To let him recover, she moves away. She
goes to the window and looks out. She feels the strength of the
sun on her head, on the feverish skin of her face. She is sweating. You ought to go back to the hotel, fill the tub with bubbles, take a long, cool bath. Or go down and dive into the tiled
pool and then try the Dominican buffet at the restaurant in the
Hotel Jaragua, they'll have beans with rice and pork. But you
don’t feel like doing that. You’d rather go to the airport, take
the first plane to New York, and resume your life at the busy
law firm, and in your apartment at 73rd and Madison.

She sits down again on the bed. Her father closes his eyes.
Is he sleeping or pretending to sleep because of the fear you inspire in him? You’re giving the poor invalid a bad time. Is that
what you wanted? To frighten him, inflict a few hours of terror
on him? Do you feel better now? Weariness has overwhelmed
her, and since her eyes are beginning to close, she gets to her
feet.

In a mechanical way she goes to the large armoire of dark

190
wood that takes up one whole wall of the room. It is half
empty. On wire hangers she sees a dark gray suit, yellowing
like the skin of an onion, and a few shirts, washed but not
ironed; two of them are missing buttons. Is this all that is left
of the wardrobe of the President of the Senate, Agustin
Cabral? He had been an elegant man. Meticulous in his person
and dress, the way the Chief liked men to be. What had happened to his dinner jackets, his dress tails, his dark suits made
of English worsted, the white ones of finest linen? The servants
must have stolen them, the nurses, the impoverished relatives.

Weariness is stronger than her will to stay awake. Finally,
she lies down on the bed and closes her eyes. Before she falls
asleep, she thinks that the bed smells of old man, old sheets,
very old dreams and nightmares.
