“Good morning,” he replied.

Colonel Johnny Abbes had placed on his desk the daily
morning report on the previous night’s events, along
with warnings and suggestions. He liked reading them; the
colonel didn’t waste time on stupid shit, like the former head
of the SIM, General Arturo R. Espaillat (Razor), a graduate of
West Point who’d bored him with his lunatic strategies. Had
Razor worked for the CIA? They assured him he had. But
Johnny Abbes couldn’t confirm it. If there was anybody not
working for the CIA it was the colonel: he hated the Yankees.

“Coffee, Excellency?”

Johnny Abbes was in uniform. Though he made an effort
to wear it with the correctness Trujillo demanded, he could not
do more than his flaccid, misshapen physique allowed. Fairly
short, with a protruding belly that complemented his dewlaps,
and a prominent chin divided by a deep cleft. His cheeks were
flabby too. Only his cruel, shifting eyes revealed the intelligence
behind the physical calamity. He was thirty-five or thirty-six
years old but looked like an old man. He hadn’t gone to West
Point or to any military academy; he wouldn’t have been admitted, for he lacked a soldier’s physique and a military vocation.
He was what Gittleman, the Benefactor’s instructor when he
was a Marine, would have called “a toad in body and soul”: no
muscles, too much fat, and an excessive fondness for intrigue.
Trujillo made him a colonel overnight when, in one of those inspirations that marked his political career, he decided to name
him head of the SIM to replace Razor. Why did he do it? Not
because Abbes was cruel but because he was cold: the iciest individual Trujillo had ever known in this country of hot bodies
and souls. Was it a fortunate decision? Recently the colonel had

66

 
made errors. The failed attempt on the life of President Betancourt was not the only one; he had also been wrong about the
supposed uprising against Fidel Castro by Commanders Eloy
Gutiérrez Menoyo and William Morgan, which had turned out
to be a trick by the Beard to draw Cuban exiles to the island and
capture them. The Benefactor was thoughtful as he turned the
pages of the report and sipped his coffee.

“You insist on pulling Bishop Reilly out of Santo
Domingo Academy,” he murmured. “Sit down, have some
coffee.”

“If you'll permit me, Excellency?”

The colonel’s melodious voice dated from his youth, when
he had been a radio announcer commenting on baseball, basketball, and horse races. From that period, he had kept only his
fondness for esoteric reading—he admitted he was a Rosicrucian—the handkerchiefs he dyed red because, he said, it was a
lucky color for an Aries, and his ability to see each person’s
aura (all of it bullshit that made the Generalissimo laugh). He
settled himself in front of the Chief’s desk, holding a cup of
coffee in his hand. It was still dark outside, and the office was
half in shadow, barely lit by a small lamp that enclosed Trujillo’s hands in a golden circle.

“That abscess must be lanced, Excellency. Our biggest
problem isn’t Kennedy, he’s too busy with the failure of his
Cuban invasion. It’s the Church. If we don’t put an end to the
fifth columnists here, we’ll have problems. Reilly serves the
purposes of those who demand an invasion. Every day they
make him more important, while they pressure the White
House to send in the Marines to help the poor, persecuted
bishop. Don’t forget, Kennedy’s a Catholic.”

“We're all Catholics,” Trujillo said with a sigh. And demolished the colonel’s argument: “That’s a reason not to touch
him. It would give the gringos the excuse they’re looking for.”

Though there were times when the colonel’s frankness displeased Trujillo, he tolerated it. The head of the SIM had orders to speak to him with absolute sincerity even when it might

67
offend his ears. Razor didn’t dare use that prerogative in the
way Johnny Abbes did.

“I don’t think we can go back to our old relationship with
the Church, that thirty-year idyll is over,” Abbes said slowly,
his eyes like quicksilver in their sockets, as if searching the area
for ambushes. “They declared war on us on January 24, 1960,
with their Bishops’ Pastoral Letter, and their goal is to destroy
the regime. A few concessions won’t satisfy the priests. They
won’t support you again, Excellency. The Church wants war,
just like the Yankees. And in war there are only two options:
surrender to the enemy or defeat him. Bishops Panal and Reilly
are in open rebellion.”

Colonel Abbes had two plans. One, to use the paleros—
thugs armed with clubs and knives led by Bald, an ex-convict in
his service—as a shield while the cali¢s rioted, pretending to be
recalcitrant groups that had broken away from large protest
demonstrations against the terrorist bishops in La Vega and at
Santo Domingo Academy, and killed the prelates before the
police could rescue them. This formula was risky; it might provoke an invasion. The advantage was that the death of the two
bishops would paralyze the rest of the clergy for a long time to
come. In the other plan, the police rescued Panal and Reilly before they could be lynched by a mob, and the government deported them to Spain and the United States, arguing that this
was the only way to guarantee their safety. Congress would
pass a law establishing that all priests who exercised their ministry in the country had to be Dominicans by birth. Foreigners
or naturalized citizens would be returned to their own countries. In this way—the colonel consulted a notebook—the
Catholic clergy would be reduced by a third. The minority of
native-born priests would be manageable.

He stopped speaking when the Benefactor, whose head
had been lowered, looked up.

“That’s what Fidel Castro did in Cuba.”

Johnny Abbes nodded:

“There the Church started out with protests too, and

68
ended up conspiring to prepare the way for the Yankees. Castro
threw out the foreign priests and took drastic measures against
the ones who were left. What happened to him? Nothing.”

“So far,” the Benefactor corrected him. “Kennedy will send
the Marines to Cuba any day now. And this time it won’t be
the kind of mess they made last month at the Bay of Pigs.”

“In that case, the Beard will die fighting,” Johnny Abbes
agreed. “And it isn’t impossible that the Marines will land here.
And yourve decided that we'll die fighting too.”

Trujillo gave a mocking little laugh. If they had to die
fighting the Marines, how many Dominicans would sacrifice
themselves with him? The soldiers would, no doubt about
that. They proved it during the invasion sent by Fidel on June
14, 1959. They fought well, they wiped out the invaders in
just a few days, in the mountains of Costanza, on the beaches
of Maimon and Estero Hondo. But the Marines . . .

“I won't have many with me, I’m afraid. The rats running |
away will raise a dust storm. But you won’t have a choice,
you'll have to die with me. Wherever you go you'll face jail, or
assassination by the enemies you have all over the world.”

“TP’ve made them defending the regime, Excellency.”

“Of all the men around me, the only one who couldn’t betray me, even if he wanted to, is you,” an amused Trujillo insisted. “I’m the only person you can get close to, the only one
who doesn’t hate you or dream about killing you. We’re married till death do us part.”

He laughed again, in a good humor, examining the colonel
the way an entomologist examines an insect difficult to classify.
They said a lot of things about Abbés, especially about his cruelty. It was an advantage for somebody in his position. They
said, for example, that his father, an American of German descent, found little Johnny, still in short pants, sticking pins into
the eyes of chicks in the henhouse. That as a young man he
sold medical students cadavers he had robbed from graves in
Independencia Cemetery. That though he was married to
Lupita, a hideous Mexican, hard as nails, who carried a pistol

69
in her handbag, he was a faggot. Even that he had gone to bed
with Kid Trujillo, the Generalissimo’s half brother.

“Youve heard what they say about you,” he said, looking
him in the eye and laughing. “Some of it must be true. Did you
like poking out chickens’ eyes when you were a kid? Did you
rob the graves at Independencia Cemetery and sell the
corpses?”

The colonel barely smiled.

“The first probably isn’t true, I don’t remember doing it.
The second is only half true. They weren’t cadavers, Excellency. Bones and skulls washed up to the surface by the rain.
To earn a few pesos. Now they say that as head of the SIM, ’'m
retuming the bones.”

“And what about you being a faggot?”

The colonel didn’t become upset this time either. His voice
maintained a clinical indifference.

“P’ve never gone in for that, Excellency. Pve never gone to
bed with a man.”

“Okay, enough bullshit,” he cut him off,.becoming serious.
“Don’t touch the bishops, for now. We'll see how things develop. If they can be punished, we'll do it. For the moment,
just keep an eye on them. Go on with the war of nerves. Don’t
let them sleep or eat in peace. Maybe they'll decide to leave on
their own.”

Would the two bishops get their way and be as smug as
that black bastard Betancourt? Again he felt his anger rise. That
rat in Caracas had gotten the OAS to sanction the Dominican
Republic and pressured the member countries to break off relations and apply economic pressures that were strangling the
nation. Each day, each hour, they were damaging what had
been a brilliant economy. And Betancourt was still alive, the
standard-bearer of freedom, displaying his burned hands on
television, proud of having survived a stupid attempt that
never should have been left to those assholes in the Venezuelan
military. Next time the SIM would run everything. In his technical, impersonal way, Abbes explained the new operation that

70
would culminate in the powerful explosion, set off by remote
control, of a device purchased for a king’s ransom in
Czechoslovakia and stored now at the Dominican consulate in
Haiti. It would be easy to take it from there to Caracas at the
opportune moment. |

Ever since 1958, when he decided to promote him to the
position he now held, the Benefactor had met every day with
the colonel, in this office, at Mahogany House, wherever he
might be, and always at this time of day. Like the Generalissimo, Johnny Abbes never took a vacation. Trujillo first heard
about him from General Espaillat. The former head of the Intelligence Service had surprised him with a precise, detailed report on Dominican exiles in Mexico City: what they were
doing, what they were plotting, where they lived, where they
_ met, who was helping them, which diplomats they visited.

“How many people do you have in Mexico to be so well
informed about those bastards?”

“All the information comes from one person, Excellency.”
Razor gestured with professional satisfaction. “He’s very
young. Johnny Abbes Garcia. Perhaps you’ve met his father, a
half-German gringo who came here to work for the electric
company and married a Dominican. The boy was a sports reporter and something of a poet. I began to use him as an infor. Mant on people in radio and the press, and at the Gomez
Pharmacy gatherings that the intellectuals attend. He did so
well I sent him to Mexico City on a phony scholarship. And
now, as you can see, he’s gained the confidence of the entire
exile community. He gets on well with everybody. I don’t
know how he does it, Excellency, but in Mexico he even got
close to Lombardo Toledano, the leftist union leader. Imagine,
the ugly broad he married was secretary to that Red.”

Poor Razor! By talking so enthusiastically, he began to lose
the directorship of the Intelligence Service that he had trained
for at West Point.

“Bring him here, give him a job where I can watch him,”
Trujillo ordered.

71
That was how the awkward, unprepossessing figure with
the perpetually darting eyes had appeared in the corridors of
the National Palace. He occupied a low-level position in the
Office of Information. Trujillo studied him at a distance. From
the time he had been very young, in San Cristébal, he had followed those intuitions which, after a simple glance, a brief
chat, a mere allusion, made him certain a person could be useful to him. That was how he chose many of his collaborators,
and he hadn’t done too badly. For several weeks Johnny Abbes
Garcia worked in an obscure office, under the direction of the
poet Ramodn Emilio Jiménez, along with Dipp Velarde Font,
Querol, and Grimaldi, writing supposed letters from readers to
“The Public Forum” in the paper El Caribe. Before putting
him to the test, he waited for a sign, not knowing exactly what
form it would take. It came in the most unexpected way, on
the day he saw Johnny Abbes in a Palace corridor conversing
with one of his ministers. What did the meticulous, pious, austere Joaquin Balaguer have to talk about with Razor's informant?

“Nothing in particular, Excellency,” Balaguer explained
when it was time for his ministerial meeting. “I did not know
the young man. When I saw him so absorbed in his reading,
for he was reading as he walked, my curiosity was piqued. You
know how much I love books. I could not have been more astonished. He cannot be in his right mind. Do you know what
he was enjoying so much? A book about Chinese tortures,
with photographs of those who had been decapitated and
skinned alive.”

That night he sent for him. Abbes seemed so overwhelmed—with joy, fear, or both—by the unexpected honor
that he could hardly get the words out when he greeted the
Benefactor.

“You did good work in Mexico,” he said in the sharp,
high-pitched voice that, like his gaze, had a paralyzing effect on
his interlocutors. “Espaillat told me about it. I think you can
take on more serious tasks. Are you interested?”

72
“Anything Your Excellency desires.” He stood motionless,
his feet together, like a student in front of his teacher.

“Did you know José Almoina in Mexico? A Galician who
came here with the Republican exiles from Spain.”

“Yes, Excellency. I mean, only by sight. But I did know
many people in the group he meets with in the Café Comercio.
They call themselves ‘Dominican Spaniards.’ ” |

“This individual published a book attacking me, A Satrapy
in the Caribbean, that was paid for by the Guatemalan government. He used an alias, Gregorio Bustamante. Then, to throw us
off the track, he had the gall to publish another book in Argentina,
I Was Trujillo’s Secretary, and this time he used his own name
and praised me to the skies. That was several years ago, and he
feels safe there in Mexico. He thinks [ve forgotten that he defamed my family and the regime that fed him. There’s no
statute of limitations on crimes like that. Do you want to take
care of it?”

“It would be a great honor, Excellency,” Abbes Garcia responded immediately, with a confidence he had not shown
until that moment.

Some time later, the Generalissimo’s former secretary, private tutor to Ramfis, and hack writer for Dona Maria
Martinez, the Bountiful First Lady, died in the Mexican capital
in a rain of bullets. There was the obligatory outcry from the
exiles and the press, but no one could prove, as they claimed,
that the assassination had been the work of “the long arm of
Trujillo.” A fast, impeccable operation that cost less than fifteen hundred dollars, according to the bill submitted by
Johnny Abbes Garcia on his return from Mexico. The Benefactor inducted him into the Army with the rank of colonel.

The elimination of José Almoina was just one in the long
series of brilliant operations carried out by the colonel, killing
or maiming or severely wounding dozens of the most outspoken exiles in Cuba, Mexico, Guatemala, New York, Costa Rica,
and Venezuela. Lightning-quick, clean pieces of work that impressed the Benefactor. Each one a small masterpiece in its skill

73
and secrecy, the work of a watchmaker. Most of the time, in addition to killing off enemies, Abbes Garcia arranged to ruin
their reputations. The unionist Roberto Lamada, a refugee in
Havana, died of a beating he received in a brothel in the Barrio
Chino at the hands of hoodlums who filed a complaint against
him with the police, charging him with attempting to stab a
prostitute who refused to submit to the sadomasochistic perversions the exile had demanded; the woman, a tearful mulatta
with dyed red hair, appeared in Carteles and Bohemia, displaying
the wounds the degenerate had inflicted on her. The lawyer
Bayardo Cipriota perished in Caracas in a homosexual dispute:
he was found stabbed to death in a cheap hotel, wearing panties
and a bra, with lipstick on his mouth. The forensic examination
determined that he had sperm in his rectum. How did Colonel
Abbes manage to establish contact so rapidly, in cities he barely
knew, with denizens of the underworld, the gangsters, killers,
traffickers, thugs, prostitutes, pimps, and pickpockets, who
were always involved in the scandals, the delight of the sensationalist press, in which the regime’s enemies found themselves
embroiled? How did he set up so efficient a network of informants and thugs throughout most of Latin America and the
United States and spend so little money? Trujillo’s time was too
valuable to be wasted checking into details. But from a distance
he admired, like a connoisseur with a precious jewel, the subtlety and originality with which Johnny Abbes Garcia rid the
regime of its enemies. Exile groups and hostile governments
could never establish any link between these horrendous acts
and the Generalissimo. One of his most perfect achievements
had to do with Ramon Marrero Aristy, the author of Over, a
novel, known all over Latin America, about sugarcane cutters in
La Romana. The former editor of La Nacion, a frantically Trujillista newspaper, Marrero had been Minister of Labor in 1956,
and again in 1959, when he began to send reports to Tad Szulc,
a journalist, so that he could defame the regime in his articles
for The New York Times. When he was found out, Marrero sent
retractions to the gringo paper. And came with his tail between

74
his legs to Trujillo’s office to crawl, cry, beg forgiveness, and
swear he had never betrayed him and never would betray him.
The Benefactor listened without saying a word and then, coldly,
he slapped him. Marrero, who was sweating, reached for his
handkerchief, and Colonel Guarionex Estrella Sadhal4, head of
the military adjutants, shot him dead right there in the office.
Abbes Garcia was charged with finishing the operation, and less
than an hour later a car skidded—in front of witnesses—over a
precipice in the Cordillera Central on the road to Constanza; in
the crash Marrero Aristy and his driver were burned beyond
recognition. Wasn’t it obvious that Colonel Johnny Abbes Garcia ought to replace Razor as the head of the Intelligence Service? If he had been running the agency when Galindez was
kidnapped in New York, an operation directed by Espaillat, the
scandal that did so much harm to the regime’s international image probably would never have come to light.

Trujillo pointed at the report on his desk with a contemptuous air:

“Another conspiracy to kill me led by Juan Tomds Diaz?
And organized by Consul Henry Dearborn, the asshole from
the CIA?”

Colonel Abbes Garcia abandoned his immobility long
enough to shift his buttocks in the chair.

“That’s what it looks like, Excellency.” He nodded, not attributing too much importance to the matter.

“It’s funny,” Trujillo interrupted him. “They broke off relations with us, obeying the OAS resolution. And called home
their diplomats but left us Henry Dearborn and his agents so
they could keep on cooking up plots. Are you sure Juan Tomds
is part of it?”

“No, Excellency, just some vague hints. But ever since you
dismissed him, General Diaz has been seething with resentment and that’s why I keep a close eye on him. There are these
meetings at his house in Gazcue. You should always expect the
worst from a resentful man.”

“It wasn’t the dismissal,” Trujillo said aloud as if talking to

75
himself. “It was because I called him a coward. To remind him
he had dishonored the uniform.”

“I was at that luncheon, Excellency. I thought General
Diaz would get up and leave. But he stayed, turned pale, broke
into a sweat. When he left he was staggering, like a drunk.”

“Juan Tomds was always very proud, and he needed a lesson,” said Trujillo. “He conducted himself like a weakling in
Constanza. I don’t allow weak generals in the Dominican
Armed Forces.”

The incident had occurred a few months after the defeat of
the landings at Constanza, Maimdén, and Estero Hondo, when
all the members of the expeditionary force—including Cubans,
North Americans, and Venezuelans, in addition to Dominicans—were either dead or in prison, and the regime discovered, in January 1960, a vast network of clandestine
opposition called June 14, in honor of the invasion. Its members were students and young professionals of the middle and
upper classes, many from families that were part of the regime.
At the height of a cleanup operation against the subversive organization, in which the three Mirabal sisters and their husbands were very active—the mere thought of them made the
Generalissimo’s blood boil—Trujillo held a luncheon in the
National Palace for some fifty military and civilian figures
prominent in the regime, in order to punish his boyhood
friend and comrade in arms, who had held the highest positions in the Armed Forces during the Era and whom he
had dismissed as commander of the Military Region of La
Vega,which included Constanza, because he had not exterminated the last concentrations of invaders scattered across the
mountains. General Juan Tomds Diaz had been asking in vain
for an audience with the Generalissimo ever since. He must
have been surprised to receive an invitation to the luncheon,
after his brother Gracita sought asylum in the Brazilian embassy. The Chief did not greet him or say a word to him during
the meal, and did not even glance at the corner where General
Diaz was seated, far from the head of the long table, a symbolic

76
indication of his fall from grace.

Suddenly, as they were serving the coffee, over the conversations buzzing around the long table, over the marble of the
walls and the crystal of the blazing chandelier—the only
woman present was Isabel Mayer, the Trujillista caudilla in the
northeast—the thin, sharp voice known to all Dominicans
rose, taking on the steel-barbed tone that foretold a storm:

“Aren’t you surprised, gentlemen, by the presence at this
table, surrounded by the most outstanding military and civilian
figures in the regime, of an officer stripped of his command because he was not equal to the task on the field of battle?”

Silence fell. The fifty heads flanking the huge quadrangle of
embroidered tablecloths all froze. The Benefactor did not look
toward General Diaz’s corner. He inspected the other diners one
by one, a surprised expression on his face, his eyes very wide and
his lips parted, asking his guests to help him solve the mystery.

“Do you know who I mean?” he continued, after a dramatic pause. “General Juan Tomas Diaz, Commander of the
Military Region of La Vega at the time of the CubanVenezuelan invasion, was dismissed in the middle of the war
for conduct unbecoming an officer in the face of the enemy.
Anywhere else, such behavior is punished with a summary
court-martial and a firing squad. Under the dictatorship of
Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina, the cowardly general is invited to lunch at the Palace with the nation’s elite.”

He said the last sentence very slowly, syllable by syllable, to
emphasize his sarcasm.

“If you'll permit me, Excellency,” stammered General Juan
Tomas Diaz, making a superhuman effort, “I'd like to recall
that at the time of my dismissal, the invaders had been defeated. I did my duty.”

He was a strong, robust man, but he had shrunk in his
seat. He was very pale and his mouth kept filling with saliva.
He looked at the Benefactor, but he, as if he had not seen or
heard him, glanced around for a second time at his guests and
spoke again:

77
“And not only is he invited to the Palace. He goes into retirement with full salary and all the prerogatives of a three-star
general, so that he can rest knowing he did his duty. And enjoy
a well-deserved leisure on his cattle ranches, in the company of
Chana Diaz, his fifth wife, who is also his niece, his brother’s
daughter. What greater proof of the magnanimity of this
bloodthirsty dictatorship?”

When he finished speaking, the Benefactors head had
looked all around the table. And now it stopped at the corner
where General Juan Tomds Dfaz was sitting. The Chief’s face
was no longer the ironic, melodramatic one it had been a moment before. It was frozen in deadly seriousness. His eyes had
taken on the solemn fixity, piercing and merciless, with which
he reminded people who it was who ruled this country and the
lives of Dominicans. Juan Tomas Diaz looked down.

“General D{az refused to follow an order of mine and permitted himself to reprimand an officer who was carrying it
out,” he said slowly, scornfully. “At the height of the invasion.
When our enemies, armed by Fidel Castro, by Mufioz Marin,
Betancourt and Figueres, that envious mob, had ruthlessly
landed and murdered Dominican soldiers, determined to have
the heads of every one of us sitting at this table. That was when
the military commander of La Vega discovered he was a compassionate man. A delicate-man, an enemy of violent passions,
who could not bear to watch the shedding of blood. And he
permitted himself to disregard my order to shoot in the field
every invader captured with a gun in his hand. And to insult an
officer who, respectful of the chain of command, gave their
just deserts to those who came here to install a Communist
dictatorship. The general permitted himself, in that ume of
danger for the Fatherland, to sow confusion and weaken the
morale of our soldiers. That is why he is no longer part of the
Army, even though he still puts on the uniform.”

He stopped speaking in order to take a drink of water.
But as soon as he had, instead of continuing, he stood
abruptly and took his leave, bringing the luncheon to an

78
 

end: “Good afternoon, gentlemen.”

“Juan Tomas didn’t try to leave, because he knew he
wouldn’t have reached the door alive,” said Trujillo. “Well,
what conspiracy is he involved in?”

Nothing very concrete, really. For some time, at his house
in Gazcue, General Diaz and his wife, Chana, had been receiving many visitors. The pretext was seeing movies, shown outdoors in the courtyard, with a projector run by the general’s
son-in-law. Those attending were a strange mixture. From
well-known men in the regime, like the host’s father-in-law
and brother, Modesto Diaz Quesada, to former officials who
were distant from the government, like Amiama Tid and Antonio de la Maza. Colonel Abbes Garcia had made one of the servants a calié a few months ago. But the only thing he found out
was that the gentlemen talked constantly while they watched
the films, as if they were interested in the movies only because
they could muffle their conversations. In short, these weren’t
the kinds of meetings where bad things were said about the
regime between drinks of rum or whiskey, the kind worth
keeping in mind. Except that yesterday, General Diaz had a secret meeting with an emissary of Henry Dearborn, the supposed Yankee diplomat who, as Your Excellency knows, is the
head of the CIA in Ciudad Trujillo.

“He probably asked a million dollars for my head,” Trujillo
remarked. “The gringo must be dizzy with so many shiteaters
asking for financial aid to finish me off. Where did they meet?”

“In the Hotel El Embajador, Excellency.”

The Benefactor thought for a moment. Would Juan Tomds
be capable of organizing something serious? Twenty years ago,
maybe. He was a man of action back then. But he had become
a pleasure seeker. He liked drinking and cockfights too much,
and eating, having a good time with his friends, getting marnied and unmarried—he wouldn’t risk it all trying to overthrow
him. The gringos were leaning on a weak branch. Bah, there
was nothing to worry about.

“I agree, Excellency, for the moment I think General Diaz

79
presents no danger. P’m following his every move. We know
who visits him and who he visits. His telephone is tapped.”

Was there anything else? The Benefactor glanced at the window: it was still dark, even though it would soon be six o'clock.
But it was no longer silent. In the distance, along the periphery
of the National Palace, separated from the street by a vast expanse of lawn and trees and surrounded by a high spiked fence,
an occasional car passed, blowing its horn, and inside the building he could hear the cleaning staff, mopping, sweeping, waxing,
- shaking out the dust. He would find offices and corridors clean
and shining when he had to cross them. This idea produced a
sense of well-being.

“Excuse me for insisting, Excellency, but [Pd like to
reestablish security arrangements. On Maximo Gomez and the
Malecén, when you take your walk. And on the highway,
when you go to Mahogany House.”

A couple of months earlier he had abruptly ordered a halt
to security operations. Why? Perhaps because during one of his
excursions at dusk, as he was coming down Maximo Gomez
on the way to the ocean, he saw police barricades at every intersection blocking pedestrian and car access to the Avenida
and the Malecén while he was on his walk. And he imagined
the flood of Volkswagens with caliés that Johnny Abbes had
unleashed on the area all around his route. He felt stifled,
claustrophobic. It had also happened at night, on his way to
the Fundacién Ranch, when all along the highway he saw the
Beetles and the military barricades guarding his passage. Or
was it the fascination that danger had always held for him—the
indomitable spirit of a Marine—that led him to defy fate at the
moment of greatest danger for the regime? In any case, It was a
decision he would not revoke.

“The order stands,” he repeated in a tone that allowed no
discussion.

“As you wish, Excellency.”

He looked into the colonel’s eyes—Abbes immediately
lowered them—and he skewered him, with a humorous barb:

80
“Do you think the Fidel Castro you admire so much walks
the streets like me, without protection?”

The colonel shook his head.

“I don’t believe Fidel Castro is as romantic as you are, Excellency.”

Romantic? Him? Maybe with some of the women he had
loved, maybe with Lina Lovatén. But, outside the sentimental
arena, in politics, he had always felt classical. Rational, serene,
pragmatic, with a cool head and a long view.

“When I met him, in Mexico, he was preparing the expedition of the Granma. They thought he was a crazed Cuban, an
adventurer not worth taking seriously. From the very first,
what struck me was his total lack of emotion. Even though in
his speeches he seems tropical, exuberant, passionate. That’s
for his audience. He’s just the opposite. An icy intelligence. I
always knew he’d take power. But allow me to clarify something, Excellency. I admire Castro’s personality, the way he’s
been able to play the gringos for fools, allying himself with the
Russians and the Communist countries and using them against
Washington, like the bumpers on a car. But I don’t admire his
ideas, ’m not a Communist.”

“You're a capitalist through and through,” Trujillo said
mockingly, with a sardonic laugh. “Ultramar did very well, importing products from Germany, Austria, and the socialist
countries. Exclusive distributorships never lose money.”

“Something else to thank you for, Excellency,” the colonel
admitted. “The truth is, I never would have thought of it. I
never had any interest in business. I opened Ultramar because
you ordered me to.”

“I prefer my collaborators to make a profit instead of stealing,” the Benefactor explained. “Profits help the country, they
create jobs, produce wealth, raise the morale of the people. But
stealing demoralizes it. I imagine that since the sanctions
- things are going badly for Ultramar too.”

“Practically paralyzed. I don’t care, Excellency. Now my
twenty-four hours a day are dedicated to keeping our enemies

81
from destroying this regime and killing you.”

He spoke without emotion, in the same opaque, neutral
tone he normally used to express himself.

“Should I conclude that you admire me as much as you do
that asshole Castro?” Trujillo asked, searching out those small,
evasive cyes.

“I don’t admire you, Excellency,” Colonel Abbes murmured, lowering his eyes. “I live for you. Through you. If
you'll permit me, I am your watchdog.”

It seemed to the Benefactor that when Abbes Garcia said
these words, his voice had trembled. He knew Abbes was in no
way emotional, not fond of the effusiveness that was so frequent in the mouths of his other courtiers, and so he continued
to scrutinize hum with his knifelike gaze.

“If Pm killed, it will be by someone very close, a traitor in
the family, so to speak,” he said, as if talking about someone
else. “For you, it would be a great misfortune.”

“And for the country, Excellency.”

“That’s why I'm still in the saddle,” Trujillo agreed. “Otherwise I would have retired, as I was advised to do by my Yankee friends who were sent down here by President
Eisenhower: William Pawley, General Clark, Senator Smathers. ‘Go down in history as a magnanimous statesman who
turned the helm over to younger men.’ That’s what Roosevelt’s
friend Smathers told me. It was a message from the White
House. That’s why they came. To ask me to leave and to offer
me asylum in the United States. ‘Your patrimony will be safe
there.’ Those assholes confuse me with Batista, with Rojas
Pinilla and Pérez Jiménez. They'll only get me out when ’m
dead.”

The Benefactor became distracted again, thinking about
Guadalupe, Lupe to her friends, the fat, mannish Mexican
Johnny Abbes married during that mysterious, adventurous
period of his life in Mexico when he was sending detailed re- ©
ports to Razor on the activities of the Dominican exiles, and at
the same time frequenting revolutionary circles, like the one

82
made up of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and the July 26
Cubans, who were preparing the expedition of the Granma,
and people like Vicente Lombardo Toledano, closely connected to the Mexican government, who had been his protector. The Generalissimo had never had time to question him
calmly about that period in his life, when the colonel discovered his vocation and talent for espionage and clandestine operations. A juicy life, no doubt about it, full of anecdotes. Why
had he ever married that awful woman?

“There’s something I always forget to ask you,” he said
with the vulgarity he used when speaking to his collaborators.
“How did you ever marry such an ugly woman?”

He did not detect the slightest sign of surprise on Abbes
Garcia’s face. |

“It wasn’t for love, Excellency.”

“T always knew that,” said the Benefactor, smiling. “She is_ mt rich, so you didn’t do it for money.”

“It was gratitude. Lupe saved my life once. She’s killed for
me. When she was Lombardo Toledano’s secretary and I had
just come to Mexico. Thanks to Vicente I began to understand
politics. Much of what Pve done wouldn’t have been possible
without Lupe, Excellency. She doesn’t know the meaning of
fear. And until now her instincts have never failed.”

“TI know she’s tough, and knows how to fight, and carries a
pistol and goes to whorehouses like a man,” said the Generalissimo, in excellent humor. “I’ve even heard that Puchita Brazoban saves girls for her. But what intrigues me is that you’ve
been able to make babies with that freak.”

“I try to be a good husband, Excellency.”

The Benefactor began to laugh, the sonorous laughter of
other days.

“You can be amusing when you want to be,” he congratulated him. “So you took her out of gratitude. And you can get
it up whenever you want to.”

“In a manner of speaking, Excellency. The truth is, I don’t
love Lupe and she doesn’t love me. At least not in the way people

83
understand love. We’re united by something stronger. Dangers
shared shoulder to shoulder, staring death in the face. And lots
of blood, on both of us.”

The Benefactor nodded. He understood what he meant.
He would have liked to have a wife like that hag, damn it. He
wouldn’t have felt so alone when he had to make certain decisions. It was true, there were no ties like blood. That must be
why he felt so tied to this country of ingrates, cowards, and
traitors. Because in order to pull it out of backwardness, chaos,
ignorance, and barbarism, he had often been stained with
blood. Would these assholes thank him for it in the future?

Again he felt demoralized and crushed. Pretending to
check his watch, he glanced out of the corner of his eye at his
trousers. No stain at all on the crotch or on his fly. Knowing
that did not raise his spirits. Again the memory of the girl at
Mahogany House crossed his mind. An unpleasant episode.
Would it have been better to shoot her on the spot, while she
was looking at him with those eyes? Nonsense. He never had
fired a gun gratuitously, least of all for things in bed. Only
when there was no alternative, when it was absolutely necessary to move this country forward, or to wash away an insult.

“If you'll permit me, Excellency.”

“Yes?”

“President Balaguer announced last night on the radio that
the government would free a group of political prisoners.”

“Balaguer did what I ordered him to do. Why?”

“Tll need a list of those who'll be freed. So we can give
them haircuts, shave them, dress them in decent clothes. I
imagine they'll be interviewed by the press.”

“Pll send you the list as soon as I look it over. Balaguer
thinks these gestures are useful in diplomacy. We'll see. In any
case, he made a good presentation.”

He had Balaguer’s speech on his desk. He read the underlined paragraph aloud: “The work of His Excellency Generalissimo Dr. Rafael L. Trujillo Molina has achieved a solidity that
allows us, after thirty years of peaceful order and consecutive

84
leadership, to offer America an example of the Latin American
capacity for the conscious exercise of true representative
democracy.”

“Nicely written, isn’t it?” he remarked. “That’s the advantage of having a well-read poet as President of the Republic.
When my brother was in office, the speeches Blacky gave could
put you to sleep. Well, I know you can’t stand Balaguer.”

“I don’t mix my personal likes or dislikes with my work,
Excellency.” _

“Tve never understood why you don’t trust him. Balaguer
is the most inoffensive of my collaborators. That’s why [ve put
him where he is.”

“I think his manner, his being so discreet, is a strategy.
Deep down he isn’t a man of the regime, he works only for
Balaguer. Maybe [m wrong. As for the rest of it, I haven’t
found anything suspicious in his conduct. But I wouldn’t put
my hands to the fire for his loyalty.”

Trujillo looked at his watch. Two minutes to six. His meeting with Abbes Garcia did not last more than an hour unless
there were exceptional circumstances. He stood, and the head
of the SIM followed suit.

“If I change my mind about the bishops, Tl let you know,”
he said by way of dismissal. “Have the plan ready, 1n any case.”

“It can be put into effect the moment you decide. With
your permission, Excellency.”

As soon as Abbes Garcia left the office, the Benefactor
went to look at the sky through the window. Not a glimmer of
light yet.
