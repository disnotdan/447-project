i, When General Juan Tomas Diaz, his brother
~ Modesto, and Luis Amiama came back, and
ns * Antonio de la Maza saw their faces, he knew

before they opened their mouths that the search for General

Roman had been futile.

“It's hard to believe,” murmured Luis Amiama, biting his
thin lips. “But it looks like Pupo skipped out on us. There’s no
sign of him.”

They had gone everywhere he could have been, including
the General Staff Headquarters at December 18 Fortress; but
Luis Amiama and Bibin Roman, Pupo’s younger brother, had
been thrown out in a very unpleasant way by the guards: their
compadre could not or would not see them.

“My last hope is that he’s putting the Plan into effect on his
own,” Modesto Diaz fantasized, without much conviction.
“Mobilizing installations, persuading military leaders. In any
event, we're in a very compromised situation right now.”

They were standing in the living room of General Juan
Tomas Diaz’s house. Chana, his young wife, served them
glasses of lemonade with ice. |

“We have to hide until we know what’s going on with
Pupo,” said General Juan Tomas Diaz.

Antonio de la Maza, who had not spoken yet, felt a wave
of anger coursing through his body.

“Hide?” he exclaimed in a rage. “Cowards hide. Let’s finish
the job, Juan Tomas. Put on your general’s uniform, give us
some uniforms, and we'll go to the Palace. And that’s where
we'll call for a popular uprising.”

“You want the four of us to take the Palace?” Luis Amiama
tried to reason with him. “Have you gone crazy, Antonio?”

 

353
“Nobody’s there now, just the guards,” he insisted. “We
have to force the hand of the Trujillistas before they can react.
We'll call on the people, we can use the Palace connection to
every radio station in the country. We'll tell them to take to the
streets. In the end, the Army will support us.”

The skeptical expressions of Juan Tomas, Amiama, and
Modesto Diaz made him even angrier. They were soon joined
by Salvador Estrella Sadhala, who had just left Antonio Imbert
and Amadito at the doctor’s office, and Dr. Vélez Santana, who
had taken Pedro Livio Cedeno to the International Clinic. They
were devastated by the disappearance of Pupo Roman. They
agreed that Antonio’s idea of infiltrating the National Palace
disguised as officers was futile and rash, an act of suicide. And
all of them energetically opposed Antonio’s new proposal: to
take the body of Trujillo to Independencia Park and hang it
from the parapet so that residents of the capital could see how
he had died. Rejection by his friends provoked one of those fits
of uncontrolled rage De la Maza had recently been subject to.
Cowards! Traitors! They weren’t equal to what they had done,
ridding the Nation of the Beast! When he saw Chana Diaz
come into the living room, her eyes terrified by the shouting, he
realized he had gone too far. He muttered apologies to his
friends and fell silent. But he felt waves of nausea inside.

“We're all upset, Antonio,” said Luis Amiama, patting him
on the shoulder. “The important thing now is to find a safe
place. Until Pupo shows up. And we see how the people react
when they find out Trujillo is dead.”

An ashen Antonio de la Maza nodded. Yes, after all,
Amiama, who had worked so hard to bring the military and
highly placed officials in the regime into the conspiracy, perhaps he was right.

Luis Amiama and Modesto Diaz decided to go their separate ways; they thought they had a better chance of avoiding
detection if each was on his own. Antonio persuaded Juan
Tomas and Turk Sadhald that they should stay together. They
went through possibilities—relatives, friends—and discarded

354
them; the police would search all those houses. Vélez Santana
was the one who came up with an acceptable name:

“Robert Reid Cabral. He’s a friend of mine. Totally apolitical, all he cares about is medicine. He won’t refuse.”

He drove them in his car. General Diaz and Turk didn’t
know Robert personally, but Antonio de la Maza was a friend
of his older brother, Donald Reid Cabral, who was working in
Washington and New York in support of the conspiracy. The
young doctor was dumbfounded at being awakened close to
midnight. He knew nothing about the plot; he wasn’t even
aware that his brother Donald was collaborating with the
Americans. But as soon as he regained his color and his power
of speech, he hurried them into his small, Moorish-style, twostory house, which was so narrow it looked like something out
of a fairy tale. He was a clean-shaven boy with kindhearted eyes
who made a superhuman effort to hide his consternation. He
introduced them to his wife, Ligia, who was several months
pregnant.. She accepted the invasion by strangers goodnaturedly, without much apprehension. She showed them her
two-year-old son, who slept in a corer of the dining room. _

The young couple led the conspirators to a narrow little
room on the top floor that was used as an attic storeroom. It
had almost no ventilation, and the low ceiling made the heat
intolerable. There was room for them only if they sat with their
legs drawn up, and they had to crouch when they stood to
avoid hitting their heads on the beams. On that first night they
hardly noticed the discomfort and the heat; they spent the time
whispering, trying to guess what had happened to Pupo
Roman: why did he drop out of sight when everything depended on him? General Diaz recalled his conversation with
Pupo on May 24, Roman’s birthday, on his farm at kilometer
fourteen. He had assured him and Luis Amiama that he was
ready to mobilize the Armed Forces as soon as they showed
him the body.

Marcelino Vélez Santana stayed with them, out of solidarity, for he had no reason to hide. The next morning he went

355
out to learn the news. He returned a little before noon, highly
agitated. There was no sign of a military uprising. On the contrary, one could see a frantic mobilization of SIM Beetles and
jeeps and military trucks. Patrols were searching all the neighborhoods. There were rumors that hundreds of men, women,
old people, and children were being dragged from their houses
and taken to La Victoria, El Nueve, or La Cuarenta. In the interior as well, those suspected of anti-Trujillism were being
rounded up. A colleague from La Vega told Dr. Vélez Santana
that the entire De la Maza family, beginning with the father,
Don Vicente, and including all of Antonio’s brothers, sisters,
nephews, nieces, and cousins, had been arrested in Moca. That
city was now occupied by guards and caliés. The houses of Juan
Tomas, his brother Modesto, Imbert, and Salvador were all
surrounded by barbed-wire barricades and armed guards.

Antonio said nothing. He was not surprised. He always
knew that if the plot did not succeed, the regime’s response
would be unimaginably brutal. His heart constricted as he
thought of his aged father, Don Vicente, and his brothers
abused and mistreated by Abbes Garcia. At about one o’clock,
two black Volkswagens filled with caliés appeared on the street.
Ligia, Reid Cabral’s wife—he had gone to his office so as not
to arouse the neighbors’ suspicions — came to tell them in whispers that men wearing civilian clothes and carrying submachine
guns were searching a nearby house. Antonio exploded in a
string of curses (though he kept his voice low):

“You should have listened to me, assholes. Wouldn’t it be
better to die fighting in the Palace than to be trapped here like
rats?”

Throughout the day they kept arguing and reproaching
one another. During one of these disputes, Vélez Santana
erupted. He grabbed General Juan Tomas Diaz by the shirt
and accused him of involving him for no reason in a stupid, absurd plot that hadn’t even made provision for the conspirators’
escape. Did he have any idea what would happen to them
now? Turk Estrella Sadhala came between them to prevent a

356
fistfight. Antonio controlled his desire to vomit.

On the second night, they were so exhausted by arguments
and insults that they slept, huddled together, using one another as pillows, dripping perspiration, almost suffocating in
the burning air.

On the third day, when Dr. Vélez Santana brought a copy of
El Caribe to their hiding place and they saw their photographs
under a huge headline: “Killers Sought in Trujillo Murder,” and,
below that, the photograph of General Roman Fernandez embracing Ramfis at the Generalissimo’s funeral, they knew they
were lost. There would be no civilian-military junta. Ramfis and
Radhamés had returned, and the entire country was mourning
the dictator.

“Pupo betrayed us.” General Juan Tomds Diaz seemed to
be foundering. He had taken off his shoes, his feet were very
swollen, and he was gasping for breath.

“We have to get out of here,” said Antonio de la Maza.
“We can’t fuck up this family. If they find us here, they'll kill
them too.”

“You're right,” Turk agreed. “It wouldn’t be fair. We have
to leave.”

Where would they go? They spent all of June 2 considering
possible flight plans. Shortly before noon, two Beetles carrying
caliés pulled up to the house across the way and half a dozen
armed men forced the door and went in. Alerted by Ligia, they
waited, guns at the ready. But the cazés left after dragging out a
young man in handcuffs. Of all the suggestions, Antonio’s
seemed the best: get hold of a car or van and try to reach Restauracién, where he knew a good many peoplebecause he owned
pine and coffee plantations there, and managed Trujillo’s sawmill.
It was so close to the border, it wouldn’t be difficult to cross over
into Haiti. But where would they find a car? Who would lend
them one? They didn’t get any sleep that night either, tormented
by apprehension, fatigue, despair, and doubt. At midnight, Reid
Cabral came up to their garret with tears in his eyes:

“They’ve searched three houses on this street,” he pleaded.

357
“Any minute now it'll be my turn. I don’t care about dying. But
what about my wife and little boy? And the baby she’s carrying?”

They swore they'd leave the next day, no matter what. And
they did, at dusk on June 4. Salvador Estrella Sadhald decided
to go alone. He didn’t know where, but thought he had more
chance of getting away on his own than with Juan Tomas and
Antonio, whose names and faces were the ones appearing most
frequently on television and in the papers. Turk was the first to
leave, at ten minutes to six, when it was beginning to grow
dark. Through the blinds in Reid Cabral’s bedroom, Antonio
de la Maza watched him walk quickly to the corner, where he
raised his hand and hailed a cab. He felt very troubled: Turk
had been his closest friend, and they had never completely reconciled after that damn fight. There wouldn’t be another
chance.

Dr. Marcelino Vélez Santana decided to stay a little while
longer with his colleague and friend, Dr. Reid Cabral, who
seemed overwhelmed. Antonio shaved his mustache, put on an
old hat he found in the attic, and pulled it down over his ears.
Juan Tomas Diaz, however, made no effort to disguise himself.
They both embraced Dr. Vélez Santana.

“No hard feelings?”

“No hard feelings. Good hick.”

Ligia Reid Cabral, when they thanked her for her hospitality, burst into tears and made the sign of the cross over them:
“May God protect you.”

They walked eight blocks along deserted streets, their
hands in their pockets, clutching their revolvers, until they
reached the house of Antonio de la Maza’s brother-in-law,
Tonito Mota. He had a Ford van; perhaps he’d lend it to them,
or agree to let them steal it. But Tofiito wasn’t home, and the
van wasn’t in the garage. The servant who opened the door
recognized De la Maza immediately: “Don Antonio! What are
you doing here?” He had a horrified look on his face, and
Antonio and the general, certain he would call the police as
soon as they left, hurried away. They didn’t know what the hell

358
to do.

“Shall I tell you something, Juan Tomas?”

“What, Antonio?”

“Pm glad to be out of that rattrap. That heat, the dust that
got in your nose and didn’t let you breathe. The discomfort. Its
good to be in the fresh air and feel your lungs clearing out.”

“The only thing I need is for you to say: ‘Let's go have a
couple of beers and celebrate how beautiful life is.’ Brother,
you have a lot of balls!”

They both broke into intense, fleeting little laughs. On
Avenida Pasteur they tried for a long time to hail a cab. The
ones that passed had passengers.

“Tm sorry I wasn’t with you on the Avenida,” General Diaz
said suddenly, as if remembering something important. “And
didn’t have the chance to shoot the Goat. Damn it to hell!”

“It’s as if you had been there, Juan Tomas. Just ask Johnny
Abbes, Blacky, Petan, and Ramfis, then you'll see. As far as
they're concerned, you were with us on the highway pumping
the Chief full of lead. Don’t worry. I fired one of those shots
for you.”

Finally a taxi stopped. They climbed in, and when they
didn’t tell him right away where they wanted to go, the driver,
a fat, gray-haired black in shirtsleeves, turned to look at them.
Antonio de la Maza saw in his eyes that he had recognized
them.

“To San Martin,” he told him.

The driver nodded, not saying a word. A short while later,
he murmured that he was running out of gas; he had to fill the
tank. He drove along March 30, where the traffic was heavy,
and stopped at a Texaco station at the corner of San Martin
and Tiradentes. He got out of the car to open the gas tank.
Now Antonio and Juan Tomdas held the revolvers in their
hands. De la Maza took off his right shoe, twisted the heel, and
removed a small cellophane bag, which he put in his pocket.
Juan Tomas looked at him, intrigued, and Antonio explained:

“It’s strychnine. I got it in Moca; I said it was for a rabid

359
dog.”

The fat general shrugged disdainfully, and showed him his
revolver:

“There’s no better strychnine than this, brother. Poison is for
dogs and women, don’t fuck around with bullshit like that. Besides, asshole, you commit suicide with cyanide, not strychnine.”

They laughed again, with the same fierce, sad little laugh.

“Did you notice the guy at the register?” Antonio de la Maza
pointed at the cashier's window. “Who do you think he’s calling?”

“Maybe his wife, to ask how her pussy’s doing.”

Antonio de la Maza laughed again, a real, long, open laugh

this time.
| “What the fuck are you laughing at, asshole?”

“Don’t you think it’s funny?” asked Antonio, who was serious again. “The two of us in this taxi. What the hell are we doing
here? We don’t even know where we're going.”

They told the driver to go back to the colonial district.
Antonio had thought of something, and once they were in the
old city, they told him to turn onto Calle Espaillat from Billini.
Generoso Fernandez, an attorney whom they both knew, lived
there. Antonio recalled hearing him say the most bitter things
about Truyillo; perhaps he could get them a car. The lawyer
came to the door but did not ask them in. When he recovered
from the shock—he looked at them in horror, blinking —all he
could do in his indignation was berate them:

“Are you crazy? How can you compromise me like this?
Don’t you know who went into the house across the street just
a minute ago? The Constitutional Sot! Couldn’t you stop and
think before doing this to me? Get away, go on, I have a family.
For God’s sake, leave! Pm nobody, nobody.”

He slammed the door in their faces. They went back to the
cab. The old black was still sitting docilely at the wheel, not
looking at them. After a while he mumbled:

“Where to now?” |

“To Independencia Park,” Antonio told him, just to say
something.

360
Seconds after he pulled away—the streetlamps at the corners had turned on and people were coming out on the sidewalks to enjoy the cool air—the driver alerted them:

“There are Beetles behind us. I’m really sorry, gentlemen.”

Antonio felt relieved. This ridiculous trip to nowhere was
finally ending. Better to go out shooting than like a couple of
assholes. They turned around. Two green Volkswagens were
following them at a distance of about ten meters.

“I don’t want to die, gentlemen,” the driver pleaded, crossing himself. “By the Blessed Virgin, please!”

“Okay, get to the park however you can and drop us at the
corner by the hardware store,” said Antonio.

There was a good deal of traffic. The driver maneuvered his
way between a truck and bus with clusters of people hanging
from the doors. He braked hard a few meters from the large
plate-glass windows of the Reid hardware store. When he
jumped out of the cab, with his revolver in his hand, Antonio noticed that the lights in the park were coming on, as if to welcome
them. There were shoeshine boys, street peddlers, cardplayers,
bums and beggars leaning against the walls. It smelled of fruit
and fried food. He turned around to hurry along Juan Tomas,
who was fat and tired, and could not keep up with him. At that
moment, shots broke out behind him. There were deafening
screams all around him; people ran between cars, and automobiles drove onto the sidewalks. Antonio heard hysterical voices:
“Surrender, damn it!” “You’re surrounded, assholes!” When he
saw that Juan Tomds was stopping, exhausted, he stopped too,
beside him, and began to shoot. He fired blindly, because caliés
and guards were hiding behind the Volkswagens that crisscrossed the road like parapets, blocking traffic. He saw Juan
Toms fall to his knees and raise the pistol to his mouth, but he
couldn’t fire because the impact of several shots knocked him
down. By now Antonio had been hit by a number of bullets,
but he wasn’t dead. “I’m not dead, shit, ’'m not dead.” He had
fired all the rounds in his clip, and as he lay on the ground, he
tried to slip his hand into his pocket and swallow the strychnine.

361
His damn fucking hand did not obey him. No need, Antonio.
He could see the brilliant stars in the night that was just beginning, he could see Tavito’s smiling face, and he felt young

again.
