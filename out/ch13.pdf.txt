am, “You really don’t want a little more arepa?”
1. ©. Aunt Adelina insists affectionately. “Go on,

a” ~=have some. When you were little, every time
you came to the house you asked for corm cake. Don’t you like
it anymore?”

“Of course I like it, Aunt Adelina,” Urania protests. “But
Pve never eaten so much in my life. I won’t be able to sleep a
wink.”

“All right, we'll just leave it here in case you want a little
more later,” says a resigned Aunt Adelina.

Her firm voice and mental lucidity contrast with how decrepit she looks: bent, almost bald—patches of scalp can be
seen through her white hair—her face puckered into a thousand wrinkles, dentures that shift when she eats or speaks. She
is a shrunken little woman, half lost in the rocking chair where
Lucinda, Manolita, Marianita, and the Haitian maid settled her
after carrying her downstairs. Her aunt was determined to
have supper in the dining room with her brother Agustin’s
daughter, who had suddenly reappeared after so many years.
She speaks energetically, and in her small, deep-set eyes there is
a flashing intelligence. “I never would have recognized her,”
thinks Urania. Or Lucinda, and certainly not Manolita, whom
she last saw when she was eleven or twelve and who is now a |
prematurely aged matron with wrinkles on her face and neck,
and hair badly dyed a rather vulgar blue-black. Marianita, Lucinda’s daughter, must be about twenty: thin, very pale, her
hair almost in a crew cut, and melancholy eyes. She doesn’t
stop looking at Urania, as if she were under a spell. What has
_ her niece heard about her?

“I can’t believe its you, that you’re really here.” Aunt

 

228
Adelina fixes her penetrating eyes on her. “I never thought I’d
see you again.”

“Well, Aunt Adelina, here I am. It makes me so happy.”

“Me too, darling. You must have made Agustin even happier. My brother had resigned himself to never seeing you
again.” |

“I don’t know, Aunt Adelina.” Urania puts up her defenses, foresees recriminations and indiscreet questions. “I
spent all day with him, and I don’t think he even recognized
me.”

Her two cousins react in unison:

“Of course he recognized you, Uranita,” declares Lucinda.

“He can’t speak, so its hard to tell,” Manolita concurs.
“But he understands everything, his mind still works.”

“He’s still Egghead,” says Aunt Adelina with a laugh.

“We know because we see him every day,” Lucinda continues. “He recognized you, and your coming back made him
happy.”

“I hope so, Lucinda.”

A silence that is prolonged, glances that cross the old table
in the narrow dining room, with a china closet that Urania
vaguely recognizes, and religious pictures on faded green walls.
Nothing is familiar here either. In her memory, the house of
her Aunt Adelina and Uncle Anfbal, where she came to play
with Manolita and Lucinda, was large, bright, elegant, and
airy; this is a cave crowded with depressing furniture.

“Breaking my hip separated me from Agustin forever.” She
shakes her small fist, the fingers deformed by sclerosis. “Before
it happened, I used to spend hours with him. We had long
conversations. He didn’t need to talk for me to understand
what he wanted to say. My poor brother! I would have
brought him here. But where would I put him, in this rat
hole?”

She speaks angrily.

“The death of Trujillo was the beginning of the end for the
family,” Lucindita says with a sigh. And then she becomes

229
alarmed. “I’m sorry, Urania. You hate Trujillo, don’t you?”

“It started before that,” Aunt Adelina corrects her, and
Urania becomes interested in what she is saying.

“When, Grandma?” Lucinda’s oldest daughter asks in a
thin little voice.

“With the letter in ‘The Public Forum,’ a few months before they killed Trujillo,” Aunt Adelina declares; her eyes pierce
the emptiness. “In January or February of 1961. We gave the
news to your papa, early in the morning. Anibal was the first to
read it.”

“A letter in “The Public Forum’?” Urania is searching,
searching through her memories. “Ah, yes.”

“I assume it’s nothing important, a foolish mistake that
will be straightened out,” his brother-in-law said on the phone;
he sounded so agitated, so vehement, so false, that Senator
Agustin Cabral was taken aback: what was wrong with Anibal?
“Haven’t you read El Caribe?”

“They've just brought it in, I haven’t opened it yet.”

He heard a nervous little cough.

“Well, there’s a letter, Egghead.” His brother-in-law tried
to be casual, lighthearted. “It’s all nonsense. Clear it up as soon
as you can.”

“Thanks for calling me.” Senator Cabral said goodbye.
“My love to Adelina and the girls. Pil stop by to see them.”

Thirty years in the highest echelons of political power had
made Agustin Cabral a man familiar with imponderables—
traps, ambushes, trickery, betrayals—and so, learning there was
a letter attacking him in “The Public Forum,” the most widely
read, and widely feared, section in E/ Caribe because it was fed
from the National Palace and served as a political barometer
for the entire country, did not unnerve him. It was the first
time he had appeared in the infernal column; other ministers,
senators, governors, or officials had been burned in its flames,
but not him, until now. He went back to the dining room. His
daughter, in her school uniform, was eating breakfast:
mangu—plantain mashed with butter—and fried cheese. He

230
kissed the top of her head (“Hi, Papa”), sat down across from
her, and while the maid poured his coffee, he slowly, carefully
opened the folded paper lying on a corner of the table. He
turned the pages until he reached “The Public Forum”:

To the Editor:

I am writing out of civic duty to protest the affront to Dominican citizens and to the unrestricted freedom of expression which the
Zovernment of Generalissimo Trujillo guarantees to this Republic. I
refer to the fact that until now, your respected and widely read pages
have not disclosed something that everyone knows, which is that Senator Agustin Cabral, nicknamed Egghead (for what reason?) was
stripped of the Presidency of the Senate when it was determined that
he was guilty of irregularities as the Minister of Public Works, a post
he occupied until a short while ago. It is also known that because this
regime 1s scrupulous in questions of probity and the use of public
funds, an investigative committee to look into apparent mismanagement and colluston—illegal commissions, acquisition of obsolete materials at elevated prices, misleading inflation of budgets, in which
the senator would have been involved in the course of his duties as
minister —has been named to examine the charges against him.

Doesn't the Trujillista citizenry have the right to be informed
with regard to such serious matters?

Respectfully,

Telésforo Hidalgo Saino, Engineer

Calle Duarte no. 171

Ciudad Trujillo

“I have to run, Papa,” Senator Cabral heard, and without a
single gesture that would belie his apparent calm, he moved
the newspaper aside to kiss the girl. “I won’t be on the school
bus, I’m staying to play volleyball. Some friends and I will walk
home.”

“Be careful at the intersections, Uranita.”

He drank his orange juice and had an unhurried cup of
steaming, freshly brewed coffee, but did not taste the mangu
or fried cheese or toast with honey. Again he read every word, _

231
every syllable, of the letter in “The Public Forum.” It undoubtedly had been fabricated by the Constitutional Sot, a pen
pusher who delighted in sneak attacks but only when ordered
by the Chief; nobody would dare to write, let alone publish, a
letter like this without Trujillo’s authorization. When was the
last time he saw him? The day before yesterday, on his walk.
He hadn’t been called to walk beside him, the Chief spent the
whole time talking to General Roman and General Espaillat,
but he greeted him with the customary civility. Or did he? He
sharpened his memory. Had he noticed a certain hardness in
that fixed, intimidating gaze, which seemed to tear through appearances and reach deep into the soul of the person he was
scrutinizing? A certain dryness when he responded to his greeting? The beginning of a frown? No, he didn’t remember anything unusual.

The cook asked if he’d be home for lunch. No, only for
supper, and he nodded when Aleli suggested the menu. When
he heard the official car of the Senate Presidency pulling up to
the door of his house, he looked at his watch: exactly eight o’clock. Thanks to Trujillo, he had discovered that time is gold.
Like so many others, since his youth he had made the Chief’s
obsessions his own: order, exactitude, discipline, perfection.
Senator Agustin Cabral had said it in a speech: “Thanks to His
Excellency, the Benefactor, we Dominicans have discovered
the wonders of punctuality.” Putting on his jacket, he went out
to the street: “If I had been dismissed, the official car would
not have come for me.” His assistant, Humberto Arenal, an
Air Force lieutenant who had never hidden his connections to
the SIM, opened the door for him. His official car, with Teodosio at the wheel. His assistant. There was nothing to worry
about.

“He never found out why he fell into disgrace?” Urania
asks in astonishment.

“Never with any certainty,” Aunt Adelina explains. “There
were plenty of suppositions, but that’s all. For years Agustin
asked himself what he had done to make Trujillo so angry

232
overnight. And turn a man who had served him his whole life
into a pariah.”

Urania observes Marianita’s disbelief as she listens to them.

“They sound like things that happened on another planet,
' don’t they, Marianita?”

The girl blushes.

“T’s just that it seems so incredible, Aunt Urania. Like
something in The Trial, the Orson Welles movie they showed
~ at the Cinema Club. Anthony Perkins is tried and executed,
and he never finds out why.”

Manolita has been fanning herself with both hands, but she
stops in order to interject:

“They said he fell into disgrace because somebody made
Trujillo believe it was Uncle Agustin’s fault that the bishops refused to proclaim him Benefactor of the Catholic Church.”

“They said a thousand things,” exclaims Aunt Adelina.
“The doubt was the worst part of his calvary. The family was
being ruined and nobody knew what Agustin had been accused of, what he had done or failed to do.”

No other senator was there when Agustin Cabral entered
the Senate at a quarter past eight, as he did every morning. The
guards gave him the proper salute, and the ushers and clerks he
passed in the halls on the way to his office said good morning
_ with their usual effusiveness. But the uneasiness felt by his two
~ secretaries, Isabelita and Paris Goico, a young lawyer, was reflected in their faces.

“Who died?” he joked. “Are you worried about the letter
in ‘The Public Forum’? We'll clear up that nasty business right
now. Call the editor of El Caribe, Isabelita. At home—Panchito doesn’t go to his office before noon.”

He sat down at his desk, glanced at the pile of documents,
his correspondence, the day’s schedule prepared by the efficient
Parisito. “The letter was dictated by the Chief,” he thought. A
little snake slid down his spine. Was it one of those melodramas that amused the Generalissimo? In the midst of tensions
with the Church and a confrontation with the United States _

233
and the OAS, was he in the mood for one of his bravura performances from the past, when he had felt all-powerful, unthreatened? Was this the time for circuses?

“He’s on the line, Don Agustin.”

He picked up the receiver and waited a few seconds before
speaking.

“Did I wake you, Panchito?”

“What an idea, Egghead.” The journalist’s voice sounded
normal. “['m up at the crack of dawn, like a capon rooster. And
I sleep with one eye open, just in case. What’s up?”

“Well, as you can imagine, I’m calling about the letter this
morning in ‘The Public Forum,’” Senator Cabral said
hoarsely. “Can you tell me anything about it?”

The answer came in the same light, jocular tone, as if they
were talking about something trivial. !

“It came recommended, Egghead. I wasn’t going to print
something like that without checking. Believe me, given our
friendship, it didn’t make me happy to publish it.”

“Yes, yes, sure,” he murmured to himself. He mustn’t lose
his composure for a single instant.

“I intend to rectify the slander,” he said softly. “I haven’t
been dismissed from anything. I’m calling you from the office
of the President of the Senate. And that alleged committee investigating my management of the Ministry of Public Works,
that’s another lie.”

“Send me your rectification right away,” Panchito replied.
“Tl do everything I can to publish it, it’s the least I can do.
You know the esteem I have for you. Pll be at the paper from
four o’clock on. My love to Uranita. Take care of yourself,
Agustin.”

As soon as he hung up, he began to have his doubts. Had
he done the right thing in calling the editor of El Caribe? Wasn’t it a false move that betrayed his concern? What else could
Panchito have said? He received letters for “The Public Forum” directly from the National Palace and printed them, no
questions asked. He looked at his watch: a quarter to nine. He

234.
had time; the meeting of the Senate executive committee was
at nine-thirty. He dictated his rectification to Isabelita with the
same austere clarity he used in all his writing. A brief, dry, fulminating letter: he continued as President of the Senate and no
one had questioned his scrupulous management at the Min-—
istry of Public Works, entrusted to him by the regime presided
over by that eponymous Dominican, His Excellency Generalissimo Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, Benefactor and Father of the
New Nation.

When Isabelita left to type the letter, Paris Goico came
into the office.

“The meeting of the Senate executive committee has been
canceled, Don Agustin.”

He was young and didn’t know how to dissemble; his
mouth hung open and his face was livid.

“Without consulting me? By whom?”

“The Vice President of the Senate, Don Agustin. He just
told me so himself.”

He weighed what he had just heard. Could it be a separate
incident, unrelated to the letter in “The Public Forum”?
Parisito waited in distress, standing beside the desk.

“Is Dr. Quintanilla in his office?” His secretary nodded,
and he rose to his feet. “Tell him P’m on my way to see him.”

. “It can’t be that you don’t remember, Uranita,” her Aunt

Adelina admonished her. “You were fourteen years old. It was
the most serious thing that had happened in the family, even
worse than the accident that killed your mother. And you didn’t know anything about it?”

They'd had coffee and tea. Urania tried a mouthful of
arepa. They sat around the dining-room table, talking in the
wan light of a small floor lamp. The Haitian servant, as silent as
a cat, had cleared the table.

“I remember how Papa suffered, of course I do, Aunt
Adelina,” Urania explains. “I forget the details, the daily incidents. He tried to hide it from me at first. “There are some
problems, Uranita, they'll be resolved soon.’ I didn’t imagine

235
that from then on my life would turn upside down.”

She feels the eyes of her aunt, her cousins, her niece, burning into her. Lucinda says what they are all thinking:

“Some good came out of it for you, Uranita. You wouldn’t
be where you are now if it hadn’t. But for us, it was a disaster.”

“And most of all, for my poor brother,” her aunt says accusingly. “They stabbed him in the back and left him to bleed
for another thirty years.”

A parrot shrieks above Urania’s head, startling her. She hadn't realized it was there until now; the bird is agitated, moving
from side to side on its wooden bar inside a large cage with heavy
blue bars. Her aunt, cousins, and niece burst into laughter.

“This is Samson.” Manolita introduces him. “He’s upset
because we woke him. He’s a sleepyhead.”

The parrot helps to ease the atmosphere.

“Tm sure if I understood what he was saying, I’d learn a lot
of secrets,” Urania jokes, pointing at Samson.

Senator Agustin Cabral is in no mood for smiling. He responds with a solemn nod to the honeyed greeting of Dr.
Jeremias Quintanilla, Vice President of the Senate; he has just
burst into his office, and with no preliminaries, he rebukes
him:

“Why have you canceled the meeting of the Senate executive committee? Isn’t that the responsibility of the President? I
demand an explanation.”

The heavy, cocoa-colored face of Senator Quintanilla nods
repeatedly, while his lips, in a cadenced, almost musical Spanish, attempt to placate him:

“Of course, Egghead. Don’t be angry. Everything except
death has a reason.”

A plump man in his sixties, with puffy eyelids and a wet
mouth, he is wearing a blue suit and a glistening tie with silver
stripes. He smiles persistently, and Agustin Cabral sees him remove his glasses, wink at him, roll his eyes, revealing the
gleaming whites, then step toward him, take his arm, and pull
him as he says, very loudly:

236
“Let’s sit here, we'll be more comfortable.”

He doesn’t lead him to the heavy, tiger-foot chairs in his
office but to a balcony with half-opened doors. He obliges him
to go out with him so they can talk in the open air, across from
the droning hum of the ocean, away from indiscreet ears. The
sun is strong; the brilliant morning is ablaze with engines and

horns from the Malecén, and the voices of street peddlers.
| “What the hell’s going on, Monkey?” Cabral whispers.
— Quintanilla is still holding his arm and is now very serious.
In his eyes he can detect a vague feeling of solidarity or compassion.

“You know very well what’s going on, Egghead, don’t be
stupid. Didn’t you realize that three or four days ago the papers
stopped calling you a ‘distinguished gentleman’ and demoted
you to ‘sefior?” Monkey Quintanilla murmurs in his ear. “Didn’t you read El Caribe this morning? That’s what’s going on.”

For the first time since reading the letter in “The Public
Forum,” Agustin Cabral is afraid. It’s true: yesterday or the day
before somebody at the Country Club joked that the society
page in La Nacién had deprived him of “distinguished gentleman,” which was usually a bad omen: those kinds of warnings
amused the Generalissimo. This was serious. A storm. He had
to use all his experience and intelligence not to drown in it.

“Did the order to cancel the meeting of the executive committee come from the Palace?” he whispers. The Vice President, leaning over, has his ear against Cabral’s mouth.

“Where else would it come from? There’s more. All committees in which you participate are canceled. The directive says:
‘Until the status of the President of the Senate is regularized.’ ”

He is silent. It has happened. The nightmare is happening,
the one that came periodically to drag down his triumphs, his
ascent, his political achievements: he has been estranged from
the Chief.

“Who sent it to you, Monkey?”

Quintanilla’s chubby face tightens in alarm, and Cabral finally understands Monkey’s agitation. Is the Vice President

237
going to say he cannot commit an act of such disloyalty?
Abruptly, he makes his decision:

“Henry Chirinos.” He takes his arm again. “I’m sorry,
Egghead. I don’t think there’s much I can do, but if I can, you
can count on me.”

“Did Chirinos tell you what I’m accused of?”

“He only gave me the order and made a speech: ‘I know
nothing. I am the humble messenger of a higher decision.’ ”

“Your papa always suspected that the schemer was Chirinos, the Constitutional Sot,” Aunt Adelina recalls.

“That fat repulsive nigger was one of the people who made
the best accommodation,” Lucindita interrupts. “From Trujillo’s bed and board to Balaguer’s minister and ambassador.
Do you see what kind of country this is, Uranita?”

“I remember him very well, I saw him in Washington a few
years ago, when he was ambassador,” says Urania. “He often
came to the house when I was little. He seemed like one of
Papa’s intimate friends.”

“And Anjbal’s, and mine,” adds Aunt Adelina. “He would |
come here with all his flattery, he’d recite his poems for us. He
was always quoting books, pretending to be educated. He invited us to the Country Club once. I didn’t want to believe he
had betrayed his lifelong friend. Well, that’s what politics is,
you make your way over corpses.”

“Uncle Agustin had too much integrity, he was too good,
that’s why they turned on him.”

Lucindita waits for her to corroborate this, to protest the
injustice done to him. But Urania does not have the strength
to pretend. She merely listens, with an air of regret.

“But my husband, may he rest in peace, behaved like a gentleman, he gave your papa all his support.” Aunt Adelina gives
a sarcastic little laugh. “What a Quixote he was! He lost his job
at the Tobacco Company and never found work again.”

Samson the parrot lets loose another flood of shouts and_
noises that sound like curses. “Quiet, lazybones,” Lucindita

scolds him.
238
“Just as well we haven’t lost our sense of humor, girls,” exclaims Manolita.

“Find Senator Henry Chirinos and tell him I want to see
him right away, Isabel,” Senator Cabral says as he enters his office. And addressing Paris Goico: “Apparently he’s the one
who cooked up this mess.”

He sits down at his desk, prepares to review again the day’s
schedule, but becomes aware of his circumstances. Does it make
sense to sign letters, resolutions, memoranda, notes, as the
President of the Senate of the Republic? Its doubtful he still is.
The worst thing would be to show signs of discouragement to
his subordinates. Put the best face on a bad situation. He picks
up the papers and is beginning to reread the first page when he
notices that Parisito is still there. His hands are trembling:

“President Cabral, I wanted to tell you,” he stammers, devastated by emotion. “Whatever happens, ’'m with you. In everything. I know how much I owe you, Dr. Cabral.”

“Thank you, Goico. You’re new to this world, and you'll
see things that are worse. Don’t worry. We'll weather the
storm. And now, let’s get to work.”

“Senator Chirinos is expecting you at his house, Senator
Cabral.” Isabelita is speaking as she comes into the office. “He
answered himself. Do you know what he said? “The doors of
my house are open day and night to my great friend Senator
Cabral.’ ”

When he leaves the Congress building, the guards salute
him as usual. The black, funereal car is still there. But his assistant, Lieutenant Humberto Arenal, has disappeared. Teodosio,
the driver, opens the door for him.

“Senator Henry Chirinos’s house.”

The chauffeur nods, not saying a word. Later, when they
are driving along Avenida Mella, on the edge of the colonial
city, he looks at him in the rearview mirror and says:

“Since we left Congress, we’ve been followed by a Beetle
full of caliés, Senator.”

Cabral turns around: fifteen or twenty meters behind them

239
is one of the unmistakable black Volkswagens of the Intelligence Service. In the blinding morning light he can’t tell how
many cals are inside. “Now I’m escorted by people from the
SIM instead of my assistant,” he thinks. As the car enters the
crowded, narrow streets of the colonial city, lined with little
one- and two-story houses with bars at the windows and stone
entrances, he tells himself that the matter is even graver than he
supposed. If Johnny Abbes is having him followed, he may
have decided to arrest him. The story of Anselmo Paulino repeated. What he had feared so much. His brain is a red-hot
forge. What did he do? What had he said? What mistake did he
make? Whom had he seen recently? They were treating him
like an enemy of the regime. Him, him!

The car stopped at the corner of Salomé Urefia and
Duarte, and Teodosio opened the door for him. The Beetle
parked a few meters behind them but no calié got out. He was
tempted to go over and ask them why they were following the
President of the Senate, but he restrained himself: what good
would it do to challenge some poor bastards who were only
obeying orders?

Senator Henry Chirinos’s old two-story house with its little colonial balcony and jalousied windows resembled its
owner; time, age, and neglect had deformed it and made it
asymmetrical; it had widened excessively in the middle, as if it
had grown a belly and were about to explode. A long time ago
it must have been a solid, noble house; now it was dirty, neglected, and seemed on the verge of collapse. Splotches and
stains defaced the walls, and spiderwebs hung from the roof.
The door was opened as soon as he knocked. He climbed a
lugubrious, groaning staircase with a greasy banister, and on
the first landing the butler opened a creaking glass door: he
recognized the large library, the heavy velvet drapes, the tall
cases filled with books, the thick, faded carpet, the oval pictures, and the silvery threads of cobwebs catching the beams of
sunlight that penetrated the shutters. It smelled of age and
rank humors, and the heat was infernal. He remained standing

240
and waited for Chirinos. The number of times he had been
here, over so many years, for meetings, agreements, negotiations, conspiracies, all in the service of the Chief.

“Welcome to your house, Egghead. A sherry? Sweet or
dry? I recommend the fino amontillado. It’s chilled.”

Wearing pajamas and wrapped in a flamboyant green flannel robe with silk binding that accentuated the rotundity of his
body, with a huge handkerchief in the pocket, and on his feet,
backless bedroom slippers misshapen by his bunions, Senator
Chirinos smiled at him. His uncombed, thinning hair, the mu
_ cus on his puffy face, his purplish lids and lips, the dried saliva

at the corners of his mouth, revealed to Senator Cabral that he
had not yet bathed. He allowed him to pat his shoulder and

~ lead him to the ancient easy chairs with silk antimacassars over

_ the backs, without responding to the effusions of his host.

“We've known each other for many years, Henry. We've
done many things together. Good things, and some bad. No

_ two people in the regime have been as close as you and I.

What’s going on? Why did the sky start falling in on me this

_ morning?”

He had to stop talking because the butler came in, an old,
bent mulatto as ugly and slovenly as his employer, carrying a
glass decanter into which he had poured the sherry, and two

. glasses. He left them on the table and hobbled out of the
~ room.

“I don’t know.” The Constitutional Sot touched his own

~ chest. “You probably don’t believe me. You probably think
-_ Ive schemed, instigated, provoked what’s happening to you.
s By my mother’s memory, the most sacred thing in this house, I
don’t know. Since I found out yesterday afternoon, P’ve been
» utterly dumbfounded. Wait, wait, a toast. To this mess being

resolved quickly, Egghead!”
He spoke with animation and emotion, with his heart in his

~ hand and the sugary sensibility of heroes on the radio soap operas
‘. that HIZ imported, before the Castro revolution, from CMQ in
_ Havana. But Agustin Cabral knew him: he was a first-rate actor.

241
It might be true or false, he had no way to find out. He took a
small, unwilling sip of sherry, for he never drank alcohol in the
morning. Chirinos smoothed the hairs in his nostrils.

“Yesterday, at a meeting with the Chief, he suddenly ordered me to instruct Monkey Quintanilla, as Vice President of
the Senate, to cancel all meetings until the vacancy in the Presidency had been filled,” he continued, gesticulating. “I don’t
know, I thought you had an accident, a heart attack. ‘What
happened to Egghead, Chief?’ “That’s what Id like to know,’
he replied, with that gruffness that freezes your bones. “He’s no
longer one of us, he’s gone over to the enemy.’ I couldn’t ask
any more questions, his tone was categorical. He sent me to
carry out his order. And this morning, like everyone else, I read
the letter in “The Public Forum.’ Again, I swear to you on the
memory of my sainted mother: that’s all I know.”

“Did you write the letter in “The Public Forum’?”

“I write Spanish correctly,” the Constitutional Sot said
in indignation. “That 1 ignoramus committed three syaiictical
errors. Pve marked them.”

“Who was it, then?”

The fat-enclosed eyes of Senator Chirinos poured out compassion as they looked at him:

_ “What the hell difference does it make, Egghead? You’re one
of the intelligent men in this country, don’t play dumb with me,
Pve known you since you were a boy. The only thing that matters is that for some reason you’ve made the Chief angry. Talk to
him, ask his forgiveness, give him explanations, promise to make
amends. Regain his confidence.”

He picked up the glass decanter, refilled his glass, and
drank. There was less noise from the street than at Congress.
Because of the thick colonial walls, or because the narrow
streets in the center of the city discouraged cars.

“Ask his forgiveness, Henry? What have I done? Don’t I
devote my days and nights to the Chief?”

“Don’t tell me. Convince him. I already know. Don’t be
discouraged. You know how he is. Basically, a magnanimous

242
man. A deep sense of justice. If he weren’t suspicious, he
wouldn’t have lasted thirty-one years. There’s been a mistake, a
misunderstanding. It ought to be resolved. Ask him for an audience. He knows how to listen.”

As he spoke, he waved his hand, savoring every word his
ashen lips expelled. He looked even more obese seated than
when he was standing: his enormous belly had pushed open
his robe and pulsated in a rhythmic ebb and flow. Cabral
imagined those intestines dedicated, for so many hours a day,
to the arduous task of absorbing and digesting the masses of
food swallowed by that voracious maw. He regretted being
here. Did he think the Constitutional Sot would help him? If
he hadn’t actually devised this, in his heart of hearts he was
celebrating it as a great victory over someone who, despite all
appearances, had always been his rival.

“Thinking it over, racking my brains,” Chirinos added,
with a conspiratorial air, “I think the reason may be the disappointment the Chief felt when the bishops refused to proclaim
him Benefactor of the Catholic Church. You were on the commission that failed to achieve that.” .

“There were three of us, Henry! Balaguer, and Paino
Pichardo too, as Minister of the Interior and Religious Practice. The negotiations took place months ago, right after the
Pastoral Letter. Why would I get all the blame?”

“I don’t know, Egghead. In fact, it seems pretty farfetched.
I can’t see any reason either why you should fall into disgrace.
Sincerely, after all, we’ve been friends for so many years.”

“We've been something more than friends. We’ve been together, behind the Chief, in every decision that transformed
this country. We’re living history. We set traps for each other,
gave each other low blows, played dirty tricks to gain an advantage. But total annihilation seemed out of the question.
This is different. I can end up ruined, discredited, in prison.
Without knowing why! If you’ve cooked this up, congratulations. It’s a masterpiece, Henry!”

He had risen to his feet. He spoke calmly, impersonally,

243
almost didactically. Chirinos stood up too, leaning on one of
the arms of the chair to hoist his weight. They were very close,
almost touching. Cabral saw a quotation from Tagore in a
small, square frame on the wall, between the shelves of books:
An open book is a mind that speaks; closed, a friend who watts; forgotten, a soul that forgives; destroyed, a heart that weeps. “He’s pretentious in everything he does, touches, says, and feels,” he
thought.

“Frankness deserves frankness in return.” Chirinos brought
his face close to Agustin Cabral, who was dazed by the stink that
accompanied his words. “Ten years ago, five years ago, I wouldmt have hesitated to concoct anything that got you out of the
way, Agustin. And you would have done the same to me. Including annihilation. But now? To what end? Do we have some
account left to settle? No. We're no longer in competition,
Egghead, you know that as well as I do. How much oxygen is
left to a dying cause? For the last time: I have nothing to do with
what’s happening to you. My hope, my wish, 1s that you resolve
it. Difficult days are coming, and it’s to the regime’s advantage if
youre there to help withstand the onslaught.”

Senator Cabral nodded. Chirinos patted his shoulder.

“If I go down to the caliés who are waiting for me and tell
them what you’ve said, that the regime is suffocating, that it’s a
dying cause, you'll be keeping me company,” he murmured,
instead of saying goodbye.

“You won’t do that.” The great dark mouth of his host
laughed. “You’re not like me. You’re a true gentleman.”

“What happened to him?” Urania asks. “Is he still alive?”

Aunt Adelina laughs, and the parrot Samson, who seemed
to be asleep, reacts with another series of shrieks. When he
stops, Urania can hear the rhythmic creak of the rocking chair
where Manolita is sitting.

“Weeds don’t die,” her aunt explains. “He’s still in his lair
in the colonial city, at the corner of Salomé Urefia and Duarte.
Lucindita saw him a little while ago, walking with a cane in
Independencia Park, in his house slippers.”

244
“Some kids were running after him and shouting: ‘The bogeyman, the bogeyman!” Lucinda laughs. “He’s uglier and
more repulsive than ever. He must be over ninety, right?”

Have they had enough after-dinner conversation so that
she can leave? Urania hasn’t felt comfortable all night. She’s
been tense, waiting for the attack. This is the only family she
has left and she feels more distant from them than from the
stars. And she’s beginning to be irritated by Marianita’s large
eyes constantly staring at her..

“Those were terrible days for the family.” Aunt Adelina
keeps harping on the same subject.

“I remember my papa and Uncle Agustin whispering together in this living room,” says Lucindita. “And your papa
was saying: ‘But my God, what could I have done to the Chief
to make him treat me this way?’ ”

She is silenced by a dog barking wildly near the house; two
more, five more, respond. Through a small skylight in the ceiling, Urania can see the moon: round, yellow, splendid. There
were no moons like that in New York.

“What upset him most was your future if something happened to him.” Aunt Adelina’s look is heavy with reproach.
“When they took over his bank accounts, he knew it was hopeless.”

“His bank accounts!” Urania nods. “That was the first time
my papa talked to me about it.”

She was already in bed and her father came in without
knocking. He sat at the foot of her bed. In shirtsleeves, very
pale, he looked thinner, more fragile, older. He hesitated over
every syllable.

“This business is going very badly, darling. You have to be
prepared for anything. So far, Pve kept the gravity of the situation from you. But, today, well, you must have heard something at school.”

The girl nodded solemnly. She wasn’t worried; her confidence in him was limitless. How could anything bad happen to
a man who was so important?

245
“Yes, Papa, there were letters against you in “The Public
Forum,’ accusing you of crimes. Nobody will believe it, its so
silly. Everybody knows you're incapable of doing bad things.”

Her father embraced her, through the quilt.

It was more serious than slanders in the newspaper. They
had removed him from the Presidency of the Senate. A congressional committee was looking into mismanagement and
misuse of public funds during his tenure as minister. For days
the Beetles of the SIM had been following him; there was one
outside the front door right now, with three calzés inside. This
past week he had received notifications of expulsion from the
Trujillonian Institute, the Country Club, the Dominican Party,
and this afternoon, when he went to withdraw money from >
the bank, the final blow. The manager, his friend Josefo Heredia, informed him that his two accounts had been frozen for ,
the duration of the congressional investigation.

“Anything can happen, Uranita. They can confiscate this
house, throw us out on the street. Even into prison. I don’t
mean to frighten you. Maybe nothing will happen. But you
ought to be prepared. And be brave.”

She listened to him, stunned; not because of what he was
saying but because of the weakness of his voice, the hopelessness of his expression, the fear in his eyes.

“Tl pray to the Virgin,” she said. “Our Lady of Altagracia
will help us. Why don’t you talk to the Chief? He’s always
liked you. He'll give an order, and everything will be settled.”

“T’ve requested an audience and he won’t even respond,
Uranita. I go to the National Palace and the secretaries and
aides barely greet me. And President Balaguer doesn’t want to
see me, and neither does the Minister of the Interior; that’s
right, Paino Pichardo. I’m the living dead, my dear. Maybe
you're right, maybe the only thing we can do is trust in the
Virgin.”

His voice broke. But when the girl sat up to embrace him,
he regained his composure. He smiled at her:

“You had to know about this, Uranita. If anything happens

246
to me, go to your aunt and uncle. Anfbal and Adelina will take
care of you. It may be a test. Sometimes the Chief does things
like this, to test his collaborators.”

“Accusing a man like him of mismanagement,” Aunt:
Adelina says with a sigh. “Except for that little house on
Gazcue, he never had anything. No estates, no companies, no
investments. Except for his savings, the twenty-five thousand
dollars he doled out to you while you were studying up there.
The most honorable politician and the best father in the world,
Uranita. And, if you’ll permit some interference in your private
life from this doddering old aunt, you didn’t act properly with
him. I know you support him and pay for the nurse. But do you
know how much you made him suffer when you wouldn’t answer a single letter or come.to the phone when he called? Anibal
and I often saw him crying over you, right here in this house.
Now, after so much time has gone by, Urania, can I ask why?”

Urania reflects, enduring the censorious look of the old
woman bent like a hook in her chair.

“Because he wasn’t as good a father as you think, Aunt
Adelina,” she says at last.

Senator Cabral had the taxi drop him at the International
Clinic, four blocks from the Intelligence Service, which was also
located on Avenida México. When he was about to give the ad_ dress to the driver, he felt a strange rush of shame and embarrassment, and instead of telling him to go to the SIM, he mentioned
the clinic. He walked the four blocks slowly; the domains of
Johnny Abbes were probably the only important places in the
regime he had never visited, until now. The Beetle full of caliés
followed him openly, in slow motion, right next to the sidewalk,
and he could see the turning heads and alarmed expressions of
passers-by when they became aware of the emblematic Volkswagen. He recalled that when he was on the Budget Committee in
Congress, he argued in favor of the appropriation to import the
hundred Beetles in which Johnny Abbes’s caliés now cruised the
entire country looking for enemies of the regime.

At the drab, anonymous building, uniformed and plain
247
clothes police armed with submachine guns, guarding the entrance behind barbed wire and sandbags, let him pass without
searching him or demanding identification. Inside, César Baez,
one of Colonel Abbes’s adjutants, was waiting for him. Husky,
pockmarked, with curly red hair, he offered a sweating hand
and led him along narrow corridors, where men with pistols in
holsters hanging over their shoulders or dangling under their
armpits were smoking, arguing, or laughing in smoke-filled cubicles that had bulletin boards covered with memos on the
walls. It smelled of sweat, urine, and feet. A door opened.
There was the head of the SIM. Cabral was surprised at the
monastic spareness of the office, the walls bare of pictures or
posters except for the one behind the colonel, which was a portrait in parade uniform—three-cornered feathered hat, his
chest gleaming with medals—of the Benefactor. Abbes Garcia,
in civilian clothes, wore a short-sleeved summer shirt and had a
cigarette dangling from his mouth. In his hand he held the red
handkerchief that Cabral had seen so often.

“Good morning, Senator.” He extended a soft, almost
feminine hand. “Have a seat. We have few amenities here, you
must forgive us.”

“Pm grateful to you for seeing me, Colonel. You’re the
first. No one, not the Chief or President Balaguer, not a single
minister, has replied to my requests for an audience.”

The small, somewhat hunchbacked, potbellied figure nodded. Above the double chin, thin mouth, and flabby cheeks,
Cabral could see the colonel’s deep-set, watery eyes darting like
quicksilver. Could he be as cruel as they said?

“Nobody wants to risk contagion, Sefior Cabral,” Johnny
Abbes said coldly. It occurred to the senator that if snakes
could talk, they would have that same, sibilant voice. “Falling
into disgrace is an infectious disease. How can I help you?”

“Tell me what I’m accused of, Colonel.” He paused to take
a breath and appear more composed. “My conscience is clear.
Since the age of twenty I’ve devoted my life to Trujillo and to
the country. There’s been some mistake, I swear it.”

248
The colonel silenced him with a movement of the soft
hand holding the red handkerchief. He put out his cigarette in
a brass ashtray:

“Don’t waste your time giving me explanations, Dr.
Cabral. Politics is not my field, ’m concerned with security. If
the Chief refuses to see you because he’s unhappy with you,
write to him.”

“J already have, Colonel. I don’t even know if they've given
him my letters. I took them to the Palace personally.”

Johnny Abbes’s bloated face distended slightly:

“Nobody would hold back a letter addressed to the Chief,
Senator. He’s probably read them, and if you’ve been sincere,
he’ll respond.” He paused, constantly watching him with his
nervous eyes, and added, rather defiantly: “I see you’ve noticed
the color of my handkerchief. Do you know the reason? It’s a
Rosicrucian teaching. Red is a good color for me. You probably don’t believe in Rosicrucianism, you must think it’s primitive superstition.”

“I don’t know anything about the Rosicrucian religion,
Colonel. I have no opinion in that regard.”

“Now I don’t have the time, but when I was a young man
I read a lot about Rosicrucianism. I learned a number of
things. How to read a person’s aura, for example. Right now
yours is the aura of someone scared to death.”

“I am scared to death,” Cabral replied immediately. “For
days your men have been following me constantly. Tell me, at
least, if you’re going to arrest me.”

“That doesn’t depend on me,” said Johnny Abbes, casually,
as if the matter were not important. “If Pm ordered to, I will.
The escort is to discourage you from seeking asylum. If you try
that, then my men will arrest you.”

“Asylum? But, Colonel, seeking asylum, as if I were an enemy of the regime? Pve been a part of the regime for thirty years.”

“With your friend Henry Dearborn, the head of the mission
the Yankees left us,” Colonel Abbes continued, sarcastically.

Astonishment silenced Agustin Cabral. What did he mean?

249
“The American consul, my friend?” he stammered. “I’ve
seen Mr. Dearborn only two or three times in my life.”

“He’s an enemy of ours, as you know,” Abbes Garcia went
on. “When the OAS imposed sanctions, the Yankees left him
here so he could keep on plotting against the Chief. For the
past year, every conspiracy has passed through Dearbor’s office. And despite that, you, the President of the Senate, recently attended a cocktail party at his house. Do you
remember?”

Agustin Cabral’s amazement increased. Was that it? Having attended a cocktail party at the house of the chargé d’affaires appointed by the United States when they closed their
embassy?

“The Chief ordered Minister Paino Pichardo and me to attend that cocktail party,” he explained. “To sound out his government’s plans. I’ve fallen into disgrace because I obeyed an
order? I submitted a written report about the gathering.”

Colonel Abbes Garcia shrugged his rounded shoulders in a
puppetlike movement.

“If it was an order from the Chief, forget what I said,” he
conceded, with a touch of irony.

His attitude betrayed a certain impatience, but Cabral did
not leave. He was encouraged by the foolish hope that this talk
might bear some frunt.

“You and I have never been friends, Colonel,” he said,
forcing himself to speak normally.

“I can’t have friends,” Abbes Garcia replied. “It would
prejudice my work. My friends and enemies are the friends and
enemies of the regime.” oe

“Please let me finish,” Agustin Cabral continued. “But I’ve
always respected you, and recognized the exceptional service
you render the nation. If we’ve had any differences . . .”

The colonel seemed to be raising a hand to silence him, but
it was only to light another cigarette. He inhaled greedily and
calmly exhaled smoke through his mouth and nose.

“Of course we've had differences,” he acknowledged. “You

250
were one of those who fought hardest against my theory that
in view of the Yankee betrayal, we had to approach the Russians and the Eastern bloc. You, along with Balaguer and
Manuel Alfonso, have been trying to convince the Chief that
reconciliation with the Yankees is possible. Do you still believe
that bullshit?”

Was this the reason? Had Abbes Garcia stabbed him in the
back? Had the Chief accepted that idiotic idea? Were they distancing him so they could move the regime closer to the Communists? It was useless to go on humiliating himself before a
specialist in torture and assassination who, as a result of the crisis, now dared to think of himself as a political strategist.

“T still believe we have no alternative, Colonel,” he affirmed,
with conviction. “What you propose, and you'll forgive my
frankness, is an illusion. The U.S.S.R. and its satellites will never _
accept a rapprochement with the Dominican Republic, the bulwark of anti-Communism in Latin America. The United States
won’t accept it either. Do you want another eight years of American occupation? We have to come to some understanding with
Washington or it will mean the end of the regime.”

The colonel allowed his cigarette ash to fall to the floor. He
took one puff after the other, as if he were afraid someone
would take away his cigarette, and from time to time he wiped
his forehead with the flame-colored handkerchief.

“Your friend Henry Dearborn doesn’t think so, unfortunately.” He shrugged again, like a cheap comic. “He keeps trying to finance a coup against the Chief. Well, there’s no point
to this discussion. I hope your situation is resolved and I can
remove your escort. Thank you for the visit, Senator.”

He did not offer his hand. He merely nodded his fatcheeked face, partially obscured in a wreath of smoke, with the
photograph of the Chief in grand parade uniform 1n the background. Then the senator recalled the quotation from Ortega y
Gasset that was written in the notebook he always carried in
his pocket.

The parrot Samson also seems petrified by Urania’s words;

251
he is as still and mute as Aunt Adelina, who has stopped fanning herself and opened her mouth. Lucinda and Manolita are
looking at her, disconcerted. Marianita doesn’t stop blinking.
- Urania has the absurd thought that the beautiful moon she sees
through the window approves of what she has said.

“T don’t know how you can say that about your father,” her
Aunt Adelina responds. “In all my days I never knew anyone
who sacrificed more for a daughter than my poor brother. Were
you serious when you called him a bad father? He worshiped
you, and you were his torment. So you wouldn’t suffer, he didn't marry again after your mother died, even though he was
widowed so young. Who’s responsible for your being lucky
enough to study in the United States? Didn’t he spend every
cent he had on you? Is that what you call being a bad father?”

You mustn’t say anything, Urania. She’s an old woman,
spending her final years, months, weeks immobilized and embittered, she’s not to blame for something that happened so
long ago. Don’t answer her. Agree with her, pretend. Make
some excuse, say goodbye, and forget about her forever.
Calmly, without any belligerence at all, she says:

“He didn’t make those sacrifices out of love for me, Aunt

Adelina. He wanted to buy me. Salve his guilty conscience.

Knowing it would do no good, that whatever he did, he would
live the rest of his days feeling as vile and evil as he really was.”

When he left the offices of the Intelligence Service on the
corner of Avenida México and Avenida March 30, it seemed
that the police on guard gave him pitying looks, and that one
of them, staring into his eyes, meaningfully caressed the San
Cristébal submachine gun he carried over his shoulder. He felt
suffocated, and somewhat faint. Did he have the quotation
from Ortega y Gasset in his notebook? So opportune, so
prophetic. He loosened his tie and removed his jacket. Taxis
passed by but he didn’t hail any of them. Would he go home?
And feel caged, and rack his brains as he came down to his
study from his bedroom or went up again to his bedroom,
passing through the living room, asking himself a thousand

252

i
Steeyoetity, feo of oats
YS oe iy, ite 8 hip oe ty CAR
times what had happened? Why was the rabbit being pursued
by invisible hunters? They had taken away his office at the
Congress, and the official car, and his membership at the
Country Club, where he could have taken refuge, had a cool
drink, and seen from the bar a landscape of well-tended gardens and distant golfers. Or he could visit a friend, but did he
have any left? Everyone he had called on the phone sounded
frightened, reticent, hostile: he was harming them by wanting
to see them. He walked aimlessly, his jacket folded under his
arm. Could the cocktail party at Henry Dearborn’s house be
the reason? Impossible. At a meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Chief decided that he and Paino Pichardo would attend, “to explore the terrain.” How could he punish him for
obeying? Perhaps Paino suggested to Trujillo that at the cocktail party he had seemed overly cordial to the gringo. No, no,
no. Impossible that for something so trivial and stupid the
Chief would trample on a man who had served him with more
devotion and less self-interest than anyone.

He walked as if he were lost, changing direction every few
blocks. The heat made him perspire. It was the first time in
many years he had wandered the streets of Ciudad Truyillo. A
city he had seen grow, transformed from a small town in ruins,
devastated by the San Zenon hurricane of 1930, into the beautiful, prosperous, modern metropolis it was now, with paved
streets, electric lights, broad avenues filled with new cars.

When he looked at his watch it was a quarter past five. He
had been walking for two hours, and he was dying of thirst.
_ He was on Casimiro de Moya, between Pasteur and Cervantes,
a few meters from a bar: El Turey. He went in, sat down at the
first table. He ordered an ice-cold Presidente. It wasn’t airconditioned but there were fans, and the shade felt good. The
long walk had calmed him. What would happen to him? And
to Uranita? What would happen to the girl if they put him in
jail, or if, in a fit of rage, the Chief ordered him killed? Would
Adelina be prepared to rear her, be her mother? Yes, his sister
was a good, generous woman. Uranita would be another

253
daughter to her, like Lucindita and Manolita.

He tasted the beer with pleasure as he turned the pages in
his notebook, looking for the quotation from Ortega y Gasset.
The cold liquid, sliding down his throat, produced a feeling of
well-being. Don’t lose hope. The nightmare could disappear.
Didn’t that sometimes happen? He had sent three letters to the
Chief. Frank, heartfelt letters, baring his soul. Begging his forgiveness for whatever mistake he might have committed,
swearing he would do anything to make amends and redeem
himself if, by some inadvertent, thoughtless act, he had offended him. He had reminded him of his long years of service
and absolute honesty, as demonstrated by the fact that now,
when his accounts at the Reserve Bank had been frozen—some
two hundred thousand pesos, his life’s savings—he was out on
the street, with only the little house in Gazcue to live in. (He
concealed only the twenty-five thousand dollars deposited in
the Chemical Bank of New York, which he kept for an emergency.) Trujillo was magnanimous, that was true. He could be
cruel, when the country required it. But generous, too, as magnificent as that Petronius in Quo Vadis? he was always quoting.
Any day now he would summon him to the National Palace or
to Radhamés Manor. They’d have one of those theatrical ex. planations, the kind the Chief liked so much. Everything
would be settled. He would say that, for him, Trujillo had
been not only the Chief, the statesman, the founder of the Republic, but a human model, a father. The nightmare would
come to an end. His former life would rematerialize, as if by
magic. The quotation from Ortega y Gasset appeared at the
comer of a page, written in his tiny hand: “Nothing that a man
has been, is, or will be, is something he has been, is, or will be
forever; rather, it is something he became one day and will stop
being the next.” He was a living example of the precariousness
_ of existence as postulated in that philosophy. |

On one of the walls in El Turey, a poster announced that
the piano music of Maestro Enriquillo Sanchez would begin at
seven o'clock. Two tables were occupied by couples whispering

254
to one another and exchanging romantic looks. “Accusing me,
me, of being a traitor,” he thought. A man who, for Trujillo’s
sake, had renounced pleasures, diversions, money, love,
women. On a nearby chair, someone had left a copy of La
Nacwn. He picked up the paper, and just for something to do
with his hands, leafed through the pages. On page three, a
panel announced that the illustrious and very distinguished
ambassador Don Manuel Alfonso had just returned after traveling abroad for reasons of health. Manuel Alfonso! No one
had more direct access to Trujillo; the Chief favored him and
entrusted to him his most intimate affairs, from his wardrobe
and perfumes to his romantic adventures. Manuel was a friend,
and he owed him favors. He might be the key.

He paid and left. The Beetle wasn’t there. Had he evaded
them without intending to, or had the persecution stopped? A
feeling of gratitude, of jubilant hope, blossomed in his chest.

255
