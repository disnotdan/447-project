“A question, Excellency,” said Simon Gittleman,
flushed from the glasses of champagne and wine,
or, perhaps, emotion. “Of all the steps you have
raken to make this country great, which was the most difficult?”

He spoke excellent Spanish, with a very faint accent, nothing like the caricatured language full of errors and incorrect intonations mouthed by so many gringos who had paraded
through the offices and reception rooms of the National
Palace. Simon’s Spanish had improved a good deal since 1921,
when Trujillo, a young lieutenant in the National Guard, was
accepted as a student at the Officers’ Training School at Haina
and had the Marine as an instructor; back then, he mouthed a
barbaric Spanish peppered with curses. Gittleman had asked
the question in so loud a voice that conversations stopped and
twenty heads—curious, smiling, grave—turned toward the
- Benefactor, waiting for his reply.

“I can answer your question, Simon.” Trujillo adopted the
measured, hollow voice he used on solemn occasions. He fixed
his eyes on the crystal chandelier with the petal-shaped bulbs,
and added: “The second of October 1937, in Dajabén.”

Rapid glances were exchanged among the guests at the
luncheon given by Tryillo for Simon and Dorothy Gittleman,
following the ceremony in which the former Marine received
the Juan Pablo Duarte Order of Merit. When Gittleman expressed his thanks, his voice broke. Now, he tried to guess
what His Excellency was alluding to.

“Ah, the Haitians!” His slap on the table made the fine
crystal goblets, platters, glasses, and decanters ring. “The day
Your Excellency decided to cut the Gordian knot of the
Haitian invasion.”

 

192
Everyone had glasses of wine, but the Generalissimo drank
only water. He was solemn, absorbed in his memories. The silence thickened. Hieratic and theatrical, the Generalissimo
raised his hands and showed them to his guests:

“For the sake of this country, I have stained these with
blood,” he stated, emphasizing each syllable. “To keep the
blacks from colonizing us again. There were tens of thousands
of them, and they were everywhere. If I hadn’t, the Dominican
Republic would not exist today. The entire island would be
Haiti, as it was in 1840. The handful of white survivors would
be serving the blacks. That was my most difficult decision in
thirty years of government, Simon.”

“We followed your orders and traveled the entire length of
the border.” The young deputy Henry Chirinos leaned over the
enormous map displayed on the President’s desk and pointed:
“If this continues, there will be no future for the Dominican
Republic, Excellency.”

“The situation is more serious than you were told, Excellency.” The slender index finger of the young deputy Agustin _
Cabral caressed the dotted red line that moved in S curves
from Dajabén down to Pedernales. “Thousands and thousands
of them, working on plantations, in empty fields, in settlements. They’ve displaced Dominican laborers.”

“They work free of charge, not for wages, but for food.
Since there’s nothing to eat in Haiti, a little rice and beans is
plenty for them. They cost less than donkeys and dogs.”

Chirinos made a gesture and let his friend and colleague
continue:

“Talking to the ranchers and plantation owners is useless,
Excellency,” Cabral explained. “They reply by patting their
pockets. What do I care if theyre Haitians if they can harvest
the cane and work for almost nothing? Patriotism won’t make
me go against my own interests.”

He stopped speaking and looked at Deputy Chirinos, who
took up the argument:

“All through Dajabon, Elias Pifia, Independencia, and

193
Pedernales, instead of Spanish all you hear are the African
grunts of Creole.”

He looked at Agustin Cabral, who resumed speaking immediately:

“Voodoo, Santeria, African superstitions are uprooting the
Catholic religion that, like language and race, distinguishes our
nationality.”

“We’ve seen parish priests weeping in despair, Excellency,”
young Deputy Chirinos said, his voice quavering. “PreChristian savagery is taking over the country of Diego Col6n,
Juan Pablo Duarte, and Trujillo. Haitian sorcerers have more
influence than priests, medicine men more than pharmacists
and physicians.”

“The Army didn’t do anything?” Simon Gittleman took a
sip of wine. One of the white-uniformed waiters quickly refilled his glass.

“The Army does what the Chief orders, Simon, you know
that.” Only the Benefactor and the former Marine were speaking. The others listened as their heads turned from one to the
other. “The gangrene had moved very high. Montecristi, Santiago, San Juan, Azua, they were all teeming with Haitians. The
plague was spreading and no one did anything. They were
waiting for a statesman with vision, one whose hand would
not tremble.”

“Imagine a hydra with countless heads, Excellency.”
Young Deputy Chirinos’s poetic turns of phrase were accompanied by extravagant gestures. “These laborers steal work
from Dominicans who, in order to survive, sell their little plots
of ground, their farms. Who buys the land? The newly prosperous Haitians, naturally.”

“It is the second head of the hydra, Excellency,” young
Deputy Cabral specified. “They take work from nationals and,
piece by piece, appropriate our sovereignty.” |

“And our women too.” His voice thickened, and young
Henry Chirinos gave off a whiff of lechery: his reddish tongue
appeared like a snake between his thick lips. “Nothing attracts

194
black flesh more than white. Haitian violations of Dominican
women are an everyday occurrence.”

“Not to mention robberies and attacks on “property,” insisted young Agustin Cabral. “Gangs of criminals cross the
Masacre River as if there were no customs, checkpoints, or patrols. The border is like a sieve. The gangs demolish villages
and farms like swarms of locusts. Then they drive the livestock
back into Haiti, along with everything they can find to eat,
wear, or adorn themselves with. That region is no longer ours,
Excellency. We have lost our language there, our religion, our
race. It now forms part of Haitian barbarism.”

Dorothy Gittleman barely spoke Spanish and must have
been bored with this conversation regarding something that
occurred twenty-four years earlier, but she nodded very serously from time to time, looking at the Generalissimo and her
husband as if following every syllable of what they were saying.
She had been seated between the puppet president, Joaquin
Balaguer, and the Minister of the Armed Forces, General José
René (Pupo) Roman. She was a small, fragile, upright old
woman rejuvenated by the pink tones of her summer dress.
During the ceremony, when the Generalissimo had said that
the Dominican people would not forget the solidarity displayed by the Gittlemans during this difficult time, when so
many governments were stabbing them in the back, she too
had shed a few tears.

“I knew what was going on,” Trujillo declared. “But I
wanted proof, so there would be no doubts. I didn’t make a
decision even after I received an on-site report from the Constitutional Sot and Egghead, I decided to go there myself. I
traveled the length of the border on horseback, accompanied
by volunteers from the University Guard. I saw it with my
own eyes: they had invaded us again, just as they had in 1822.
Peacefully, this time. Could I allow the Haitians to remain in
my country for another twenty-two years?”

“No patriot would have allowed it,” exclaimed Senator
Henry Chirinos, raising his glass. “Least of all Generalissimo

195
Trujillo. A toast to His Excellency!”

Trujillo continued as if he hadn’t heard:

“Could I allow what happened during those twenty-two
years of occupation to happen again, allow blacks to murder,
rape, and cut the throats of Dominicans, even in churches?”

Seeing the failure of his toast, the Constitutional Sot
wheezed, drank some wine, and began to listen again.

“During the entire trip along the border with the University Guard, the cream of our youth, I examined the past,” the
Generalissimo continued, with increasing emphasis. “I recalled
the slaughter in the church at Moca. The burning of Santiago.
The march to Haiti by Dessalines and Cristébal, with nine
hundred prominent men from Moca who died along the way
or were given as slaves to the Haitian military.”

“More than two weeks since we presented our report and

the Chief hasn’t done a thing.” Young Deputy Chirinos was
agitated. “Is he going to make a decision, Egghead?”
' They had both accompanied Trujillo on his trip along the
border, with the hundred volunteers from the University
Guard, and they had just reached the city of Dajabén, breathing
more heavily than their horses. The two of them, despite their
youth, would have preferred to rest their saddle-weary bones,
but His Excellency was holding a reception for Dajabén society
and they would never offend him. There they were, suffocating
with the heat in their stiff-collared shirts and tunics, in the decorated town hall, where Trujillo, as fresh as if he had not been
riding since dawn, and wearing an impeccable blue-and-gray
uniform studded with medals and gold braid, moved among
the various groups with a glass of Carlos I in his nght hand, accepting their tributes. Then he caught sight of a young officer in
dust-covered boots who burst into the flag-draped room.

“You showed up at that gala reception, sweating and in
your field uniform.” The Benefactor abruptly turned his gaze
toward the Minister of the Armed Forces. “What disgust I felt!”

“I came to make a report to the head of my regiment, Excellency,” General Roman said in confusion, after a silence during

196
which his memory struggled to identify that long-ago episode.
“Last night a gang of Haitian criminals slipped across the border. Early this morning they attacked three farms in Capotillo
and Paroli and stole all the cattle. And left three men dead.”

“You risked your career, appearing before me in that condition,” the Generalissimo reproached him with retroactive irritation. “All right. Its the straw that broke the camePs back.
The Ministers of War and Government, and all the military
present, come here. The rest of you, please step aside.”

He had raised his thin, piercing voice to a hysterical pitch,
as he used to when he gave instructions in the barracks. He was
obeyed immediately, in the midst of voices buzzing like wasps.
The military formed a dense circle around him; gentlemen and
ladies withdrew to the walls, leaving an empty space in the center of the room decorated with streamers, paper flowers, and
little Dominican flags. A resolute President Trujillo gave the
order:

“Beginning at midnight, the forces of the Army and the
police will proceed to exterminate without mercy every person
of Haitian nationality who is in Dominican territory illegally,
except for those on the sugar plantations.” He cleared his
throat and his gray gaze moved around the circle of officers:
“Is that clear?”

The heads nodded, some with an expression of surprise,
others with glints of savage joy in their eyes. They clicked their
heels when they left.

“Head of the Dajabén Regiment: detain and put on bread
and water the officer who presented himself here in that disgraceful condition. Let the party continue. Enjoy yourselves!”

On Simon Gittleman’s face, admiration mixed with nostalgia.

“His Excellency never hesitated when it was time to act,”
said the former Marine to the entire table. “I had the honor of
training him at the school in Haina. From the first moment I
knew he would go far. But I never imagined it would be this
far.”

197
He laughed, and amiable chuckles echoed him.

“They never trembled,” Trujillo repeated, displaying his
hands again. “Because I gave the order to kill only when it was
absolutely necessary for the good of the country.”

“T read somewhere, Your Excellency, that you ordered the
soldiers to use machetes, not guns. Was that to save ammunition?” Simon Gittleman asked.

“To sugarcoat the pill, anticipating international reaction,”
Trujillo corrected him slyly. “If they only used machetes, the
operation could appear to be a spontaneous action by
campesinos, without government intervention. We Dominicans are lavish, we’ve never skimped on anything, least of all
ammunition.”

The entire table celebrated the witticism with laughter.
Simon Gittleman as well. But then he returned to the same
subject.

“Is it true about the parsley, Your Excellency? That to distinguish Dominicans from Haitians you made all the blacks say
perejil? And the ones who couldn’t pronounce it properly had
their heads cut off?”

“[ve heard that story.” Trujillo shrugged. “It’s just idle
gossip.”

He lowered his head, as if a profound thought suddenly
demanded a great effort of concentration. It hadn’t happened;
his eyes were still sharp and they did not detect the telltale stain
on his fly or between his legs. He gave a friendly smile to the
former Marine:

“Like the stories about the number of dead,” he said mockingly. “Ask the people sitting at this table and you'll hear all
kinds of figures. For example, you, Senator, how many were
there?”

Henry Chirinos’s dark face came to attention, swelling
with satisfaction at being the first one the Chief asked.

“Difficult to know.” He gestured, as he did when giving
speeches. “It has been greatly exaggerated. Between five and
eight thousand, at most.”

198
“General Arredondo, you were in Independencia at the
time, cutting throats. How many?” :

“About twenty thousand, Excellency,” replied the obese
General Arredondo, who looked caged inside his uniform. “In
the Independencia zone alone there were several thousand.
The senator underestimated the number. I was there. No less
than twenty thousand.”

“How many did you kill personally?” the Generalissimo
joked, and another wave of laughter ran around the table, making the chairs creak and the crystal sing.

“What you said about idle gossip is the absolute truth, Excellency,” the rotund officer said with a start, and his smile
turned into a grimace. “Now they blame everything on us. False,
all false.The Army obeyed orders. We began to separate the illegals from the others. But the people wouldn’t let us. Everybody
began to hunt down Haitians. Campesinos, merchants, and officials revealed their hiding places, and they hung them and beat
them to death. They burned them, sometimes. In many places,
the Army had to intervene to stop the excesses. There was a lot
of resentment against them for their thieving and plundering.”

“President Balaguer, you were one of the negotiators with
Haiti following those events,” said Trujillo, continuing his survey. “How many were there?”

The small, gray figure of the President of the Republic, half
swallowed up by his chair, stretched his benign head forward.
After observing the gathering from behind his nearsighted
man’s glasses, the soft, well-modulated voice emerged, the one
that recited poems at poetry competitions, celebrated the
crowning of Miss Dominican Republic (he was always the
Royal Poet), made speeches to the crowds on Trujillo’s political tours, or expounded on the government’s policies in the
National Assembly.

“The exact figure could never be determined, Excellency.”
He spoke slowly, with a professorial air. “A prudent estimate is
between ten and fifteen thousand. In our negotiations with the
Haitian government, we agreed on a symbolic figure: 2,750.

199
In this way, each affected family would, in theory, receive a
hundred pesos of the 275,000 in cash paid by Your Excellency’s government as a gesture of goodwill and for the sake of
Haitian-Dominican harmony. But, as you will remember, that
is not what happened.”

He fell silent, a hint of a smile on his round little face narrowing the small, pale eyes behind his thick glasses.

“Why didn’t the compensation reach the families?” asked
Simon Gittleman.

“Because the President of Haiti, Sténio Vincent, was a thief
and kept the money.” Trujillo laughed. “Only 275,000? As I recall, we agreed on 750,000 to make them stop protesting.”

“That is true, Excellency,” Dr. Balaguer replied immediately, with the same calm, perfect diction, “750,000 pesos were
agreed on, but only 275,000 in cash. The remaining half million was to be remitted in annual payments of 100,000 pesos
over a period of five years. However, and I remember this
quite clearly, I was interim Minister of Foreign Affairs at the
time, and I and Don Anselmo Paulino, who advised me during
the negotiations, imposed a clause according to which the payments were contingent upon the presentation, before an international tribunal, of the death certificates issued for the 2,750
recognized victims during the first two weeks of October
1937. Haiti never fulfilled this requirement. And consequently
the Dominican Republic was exempted from paying the remaining sum. Reparations never went beyond the initial remittance. Your Excellency made the payment out of your own
patrimony, so that it did not cost the Dominican state a cent.”

“A small amount to end a problem that might have wiped
us out,” concluded Trujillo, who was serious now. “It’s true,
some innocent people died. But we Dominicans recovered our
sovereignty. Since then our relations with Haiti have been excellent, thank God.”

He wiped his lips and took a sip of water. They had begun
to serve coffee and to offer liqueurs. He did not drink coffee,
and never drank alcohol at lunch, except in San Cristdbal, on

200
the Fundacion Ranch or in Mahogany House, in the company
of intimates. Along with the images his memory brought back
of those bloody weeks in October 1937, when his office received reports of the horrifying dimensions the hunting down
of Haitians had reached along the border and throughout the
entire country, the hateful figure again appeared of that stupid,
terrified girl watching his humiliation. He felt insulted.

“Where is Senator Agustin Cabral, the famous Egghead?”
Simon Gittleman gestured toward the Constitutional Sot: “I
see Senator Chirinos but not his inseparable partner. What
happened to him?”

The silence lasted many seconds. The diners raised their little cups of coffee to their mouths, sipped, and looked at the
tablecloth, the floral arrangements, the crystal, the chandelier
hanging from the ceiling.

“He is no longer a senator and he does not set foot in this
Palace,” the Generalissimo declaimed with the slowness characteristic of his cold rages. “He is alive, but as far as this regime
is concerned, he has ceased to exist.”

The former Marine was uncomfortable as he drained his
glass of cognac. He must be close to eighty years old, the Generalissimo estimated. He carried his years magnificently: he
kept himself erect and slim, with thinning hair in a crew cut,
not an ounce of fat or loose skin on his neck, energetic in his
gestures and movements. The web of fine wrinkles that surrounded his eyelids and extended down his weather-beaten
face betrayed his age. He grimaced and tried to change the
subject.

“How did Your Excellency feel when you gave the order to
eliminate thousands of illegal Haitians?”

“Ask your former President Truman how he felt when he
gave the order to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. Then you'll know what I felt that night in Dajabon.”

Everyone celebrated the Generalissimo’s sally. The tension
provoked by the former Marine when he mentioned Agustin
Cabral was dissipated. Now it was Trujillo who steered the

201
conversation in another direction.

“A month ago, the United States suffered a defeat at the
Bay of Pigs. The Communist Fidel Castro captured hundreds of men. What consequences will it have in the
Caribbean, Simon?”

“That expedition of Cuban patriots was betrayed by President Kennedy,” he murmured sorrowfully. “They were sent to
the slaughterhouse. The White House prohibited the air cover
and artillery support they had been promised. The Communists used them for target practice. But, if you’ll permit me,
Your Excellency. I was glad it happened. It will be a lesson to
Kennedy, whose government is infiltrated by fellow travelers.
Maybe he'll decide to get rid of them. The White House won’t
want another failure like the Bay of Pigs. Which reduces the
danger of his sending Marines to the Dominican Republic.”

As he said these final words, the former Marine became
emotional and made a noticeable effort to maintain his selfcontrol. Trujillo was surprised: had his old instructor from
Haina been on the verge of tears at the idea of a landing by his
comrades in arms to overthrow the Dominican regime?

“Excuse my weakness, Your Excellency,” Simon Gittleman
murmured, regaining his composure. “You know I love this
country as if it were my own.”

“This country is yours, Simon,” said Trujillo.

“The idea that because of leftist influences, Washington
might send Marines to fight the government that is the United
States’ best friend, seems diabolical to me. That is why I spend
time and money trying to open my countrymen’s eyes. That is
why Dorothy and I have come to Ciudad Trujillo, to fight
alongside Dominicans if the Marines land.”

A burst of applause that made the plates, glasses, and silverware resound greeted the Marine’s impassioned speech.
Dorothy smiled, nodding in solidarity with her husband.

“Your voice, Mr. Simon Gittleman, is the true voice of the
United States,” the Constitutional Sot said in exaltation, firing
- a salvo of saliva. “A toast to this friend, this man of honor. To

202
Simon Gittleman, gentlemen!”

“One moment.” The thin, high-pitched voice of Trujillo
ripped the fervent atmosphere into shreds. The other guests
looked at him, disconcerted, and Chirinos remained holding
his glass in the air. “To our friends, our sister and brother,
Dorothy and Simon Gittleman!”

Overwhelmed, the couple expressed their thanks to those
present with smiles and nods.

“Kennedy won’t send in the Marines, Simon,” said the
Generalissimo, when the echoes of the toast died down. “I
don’t think he’s that stupid. But if he does, the United States
will suffer its second Bay of Pigs. Our Armed Forces are more
modern than Castro’s. And here, with me leading them, they
will fight to the last Dominican.”

He closed his eyes, wondering if his memory would allow
him to recall the citation exactly. Yes, he had it, it came to him,
complete, from the commemoration of the twenty-ninth anniversary of his first election. He recited it, and was listened to
in reverential silence:

“ ‘Whatever surprises the future may hold in store for us,
we can be certain that the world may see Trujillo dead, but not
a fugitive like Batista, an escapee like Pérez Jiménez, or a prisoner before the bar like Rojas Pinilla. The Dominican states- man follows a different ethic and comes from a different
lineage.’ ”

He opened his eyes and sent a pleased gaze around the
_ table, and his guests, after listening to the citation with great
attention, made gestures of approval.

“Who wrote the words [ve just quoted?” asked the Benefactor.

They examined each other, looking around with curiosity,
misgiving, alarm. Finally, their eyes converged on the amiable
round face, abashed by modesty, of the diminutive writer upon
whom the first magistracy of the Republic had fallen when
Trujillo forced his brother Blacky to resign in the vain hope of
avoiding the OAS sanctions.

203
“I marvel at the memory of Your Excellency,” Joaquin Balaguer whispered, displaying excessive humility, as if stunned
by the honor being shown him. “It makes me proud that you
remember a modest speech of mine delivered on the third of
August last.”

Behind his lashes, the Generalissimo observed how the
faces of Virgilio Alvarez Pina, the Walking Turd, Paino
Pichardo, and all the generals contorted with envy. They were
suffering. They were thinking that the timid, discreet poet, the
shy professor and jurist, had just won a few points in their eternal competition to receive the favors of the Chief, to be recognized, mentioned, chosen, distinguished over the rest. He felt
tenderness for his diligent scions, whom he had maintained for
thirty years in a state of perpetual insecurity.

“Those are not mere words, Simon,” the Benefactor affirmed. “Trujillo is not one of those leaders who abandon
power when the bullets fly. I learned what honor is at your
side, in the Marines. I learned that one is a man of honor at every moment. And men of honor don’t run. They fight, and if
they have to die, they die fighting. Not Kennedy or the OAS,
not Betancourt the repulsive black faggot or Fidel Castro the
Communist, none of them is going to make Trujillo run from
_the country that owes everything it is to him.”

The Constitutional Sot began to clap, but when many
hands were lifted to follow suit, Trujillo’s gaze cut short the
applause.

“Do you know what the difference is between those cowards and me, Simon?” he continued, looking into the eyes of
his old instructor. “I was trained in the Marine Corps of the
United States of America. Pve never forgotten it. You taught
me, in Haina and in San Pedro de Macoris. Do you remember?
Those of us from that first class of the Dominican National Police are made of iron. Rancorous people said DNP stood for
‘Dominican Niggers Panic.’ The truth is, that class of men
changed the country, they created it. Pm not surprised at what
yowre doing for this nation. Because you’re a real Marine, like

204
me. A loyal man. Who dies without bowing his head, looking
at the sky, like Arabian horses. Simon, no matter how badly
your country behaves, I bear it no grudge. Because I owe what
I am to the Marines.”

“One day the United States will regret being ungrateful to
its Caribbean partner and friend.”

Trujillo took a few sips of water. Conversations resumed.
The waiters offered more coffee, more cognac and other
liqueurs, cigars. The Generalissimo listened to Simon Gittleman again:

“How is this trouble with Bishop Reilly going to end,
Your Excellency?”

He made a contemptuous gesture:

“There is no trouble, Simon. The bishop has taken the side
of our enemies. The people were angry, he became frightened,
and he ran to hide behind the nuns at Santo Domingo
Academy. What he’s doing there with so many women is his
business. We've placed guards there so he won’t be lynched.”

“It would be good if this could be resolved soon,” the former Marine insisted. “In the United States, many ill-informed.
Catholics believe the statements made by Monsignor Reilly.
That he’s being threatened, that he had to take refuge because
of a campaign of intimidation, all the rest of it.”

“It’s not mmportant, Simon. Everything will be straightened out and our relations with the Church will be excellent
again. Don’t forget that my government has always been filled
with devout Catholics, and that Pius XII awarded me the
Great Cross of the Papal Order of St. Gregory.” And abruptly
he changed the subject: “Did Petdn take you to visit the Dominican Voice?”

“Of course,” replied Simon Gittleman; Dorothy nodded,
with a broad smile.

The center that belonged to his brother, General José
Arismendi (Petan) Trujillo, had begun twenty. years earlier
with a small radio station. The Voice of Yuna had grown into a
formidable complex, the Dominican Voice, the first television

205
station, the largest radio station, the best cabaret and musical
theater on the island (Petan insisted it was the best in the
Caribbean, but the Generalissimo knew it had not managed to
unseat the Tropicana in Havana). The Gittlemans had been
impressed by the magnificent facilities; Petan himself had
been their guide, and he had them attend the rehearsal for the
Mexican ballet that would perform tonight at the cabaret.
Petan wasn’t a bad person if you dug deep enough; when the
Benefactor needed him, he could always count on him and his
picturesque private army, “the mountain fire beetles.” But,
like his other brothers, he had done him more harm than
good: because of him and a stupid fight, he had been forced to
intervene, and, to maintain the principle of authority, eliminate that magnificent giant—and his classmate at the Haina
Officers’ Training School besides—General Vazquez Rivera.
One of his best officers—a Marine, damn it—who had always
served him loyally. But the family, even if it was a family of
parasites, failures, fools, and scoundrels, came before friendship and political gain: this was a sacred commandment in his
catalogue of honor. Without abandoning his own line of
thought, the Generalissimo listened to Simon Gittleman
telling him how surprised he had been to see the photographs
of film, show business, and radio celebrities from all over the
_ Americas who had come to the Dominican Voice. Petan had

them displayed on the walls of his office: Los Panchos, Libertad Lamarque, Pedro Vargas, Ima Stimac, Pedro Infante, Celia
Cruz, Tofia la Negra, Olga Guillot, Maria Luisa Landin, Boby
Capo, Tintan and his brother Marcelo. Trujillo smiled: what
Simon didn’t know was that Petan, besides brightening the
Dominican night with the stars he brought in, also wanted to
fuck them, the way he fucked all the girls, single or married, in
his small empire of Bonao. The Generalissimo let him do what
he wanted there as long as he didn’t go too far in Ciudad Trujlo. But that crazy prick Petan sometimes fucked around in
the capital, convinced that the performers hired by the Dominican Voice were obliged to go to bed with him if he

206
wanted them to. Sometimes he was successful; other times,
there was a scandal, and he—he was always the one—had to
put out the fire, making a muillionaire’s gifts to artists who had
been offended by that moronic delinquent; Pétan had no manners with ladies. Ima Sumac, for example, an Incan princess
with an American passport. Petdn’s brashness forced the intervention of the ambassador of the United States. And the
Benefactor, distilling bile, paid damages to the Incan princess
and obliged his brother to apologize. The Benefactor sighed.
With the time he had wasted filling in the deep holes that
opened before the feet of his horde of relatives, he could have
built a second country. ©

Yes, of all the outrages committed by Petan, the one he
would never forgive was that stupid fight with the head of the
Army General Staff. The giant Vazquez Rivera had been Trujillo’s good friend since they trained together in Haina; he
possessed an uncommon strength that he cultivated by practicing every sport. He was one of the officers who contributed to
the realization of Trujillo’s dream: transforming the Army,
born of the small National Police, into a professional, disciplined, efficient force, a replica in miniature of the U.S. Army.
And then, when it had been accomplished, the stupid fight.
Petan held the rank of major and served in the leadership of the
Army General Staff. He disobeyed an order when he was
drunk, General Vazquez Rivera reprimanded him, and Petan
became insulting. The giant took off his insignia, pointed to
the courtyard, and suggested they forget about rank and resolve the matter with their fists. It was the most ferocious
beating of Petan’s life, and with it he paid for all the ones he
had given to so many poor bastards. Saddened, but convinced
that the family’s honor obliged him to act as he did, Trujillo demoted his friend and sent him to Europe on a merely symbolic
mission. A year later, the Intelligence Service informed him of
the resentful general’s subversive plans: he was visiting garrisons, meeting with former subordinates, hiding arms on his
small farm in Cibao. He had him arrested, sent to the military

207
prison at the mouth of the Nigua River, and some time later
secretly condemned to death by a military tribunal. To drag
him to the gallows, the commander of the fortress had to use
twelve prisoners serving sentences for common crimes. So
there would be no witnesses to the titanic end of General
Vazquez Rivera, Trujillo ordered the twelve outlaws shot. Despite the time that had passed, he sometimes felt, as he did
now, a certain nostalgia for that companion of his heroic years,
the one he had to sacrifice because Petan was an imbecile and a
troublemaker.

Simon Gittleman was explaining that the committees he
had established in the United States had begun collecting
money for a major campaign: that very day they would publish
full-page advertisements in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Time, the Los Angeles Times, and all the publications
that were attacking Trujillo and supporting the OAS sanctions,
to refute the accusations and argue in favor of reopening relations with the Dominican regime.

Why had Simon Gittleman asked about Agustin Cabral?
He made an effort to control the irritation that overpowered
him as soon as he thought about Egghead. There could be no
evil intent. If anyone admired and respected Trujillo, it was the
former Marine, dedicated body and soul to defending his
regime. He must have mentioned the name through an associ- —
ation of ideas, when he saw the Constitutional Sot and recalled
that Chirinos and Cabral were—in the eyes of someone who
was not privy to the workings of the regime—inseparable companions. Yes, they had been. Trujillo often gave them joint assignments. As he had in 1937, when he named them Director
General of Statistics and Director General of Migration and
sent them to travel along the border and report on the infiltration of Haitians. But the friendship between the two men was
always relative: it ceased as soon as consideration or flattery
from the Chief came into play. It amused Trujillo—an
exquisite, secret game that he could permit himself—
to observe the subtle maneuvers, the secretive stabbings, the

208
Florentine intrigues devised against one another by the Walking Turd and Egghead, but also by Virgilio Alvarez Pina and
Paino Pichardo, Joaquin Balaguer and Fello Bonnelly,
Modesto Diaz and Vicente Tolentino Rojas, and everyone else
in his close circle—to displace a comrade, move ahead, be
closer to and deserve greater attention, a closer hearing, more
jokes, from the Chief. “Like women in a harem competing to
be the favorite,” he thought. And in order to keep them always
on the alert, to keep them from becoming moth-eaten and to
avoid routine and ennui, he alternated them on the list, sending one, then the other, into disgrace. He had done it with
Cabral: distanced him, made him aware that everything he
was, everything he was worth, everything he had, he owed to
Trujillo, that without the Benefactor he was nobody. A trial he
had forced all his collaborators, close or distant, to endure.
Egghead had handled it badly and become desperate, like
a woman in love abandoned by her man. Because he wanted to
straighten things out too soon, he was making serious mistakes. He would have to swallow a lot more shit before he
came back into existence.

Could it be that Cabral, knowing Trujillo was going to
decorate the former Marine, had begged Gittleman to intercede on his behalf? Was that the reason he had mentioned, in
so inopportune a way, the name of someone who was out of
favor with the regime, as every Dominican who read “The
Public Forum” knew? Well, perhaps Simon Gittleman didn’t
read El Caribe.

His blood froze: urine was coming out. He felt it, he
thought he could see the yellow liquid pouring out of his blad-_
der without asking permission of that useless valve, that dead
prostate incapable of containing it, then moving toward his
urethra, running merrily through it and coming out in search
of air and light, through his underwear, his fly, the crotch of
his trousers. He felt faint. He closed his eyes for a few seconds,
shaken by indignation and impotence. Unfortunately, instead
of Virgilio Alvarez Pina, he had Dorothy Gittleman on his

209
right and Simon on his left, and they couldn’t help him. Virgilio could. He was president of the Dominican Party, but, in
fact, since Dr. Puigvert, brought in secret from Barcelona, had
diagnosed the damn infection in his prostate, his really important function had been to act quickly when one of these acts of
incontinence occurred, to spill a glass of water or wine on the
Benefactor and then beg a thousand pardons for his clumsiness, or, if it happened on a podium or during a parade, to
place himself like a screen in front of the stained trousers. But
the imbeciles in charge of protocol had placed Virgilio Alvarez
four seats away. Nobody could help him. When he stood up he
would suffer the horrific mortification of letting the Gittlemans and some of the guests see that he had pissed in his pants
without realizing it, like an old man. Rage kept him from moving, from pretending he was going to take a drink and spilling
the glass or pitcher that was in front of him.

Very slowly, looking around with a distracted air, he began
to move his right hand toward the glass full of water. Very,
very slowly, he drew it toward him until it was on the edge of
the table, so that the slightest movement would tip it over.
Suddenly he remembered that the first daughter born in Aminta Ledesma to his first wife, Flor de Oro—that mad little
thing with the body of a woman and the soul of a man who
changed husbands as often as she changed shoes—habitually
wet her bed until she was in high school. He had the courage
to take another peck at his trousers. Instead of the mortifying
sight, the stain he was expecting, he discovered—his sight was
still formidable, just like his memory —that his fly and pant legs
were dry. Completely dry. It had been a false impression, motivated by his fear, his panic at “passing water,” as they said about
women in labor. He was overwhelmed by happiness and optimism. The day, which had begun with bad humor and gloomy
presentiments, had just become beautiful, like the coastline
when the sun came out after a storm. _

He stood, and, like soldiers obeying a command, everyone
followed suit. As he bent down to help Dorothy Gittleman to

210
her feet, he decided, with all the strength of his soul: “Tonight, _
in Mahogany House, I'll make a girl cry out, the way I did
twenty years ago.” It seemed to him that his testicles were
coming to a boil and his penis beginning to stiffen.
