fi, “He isn’t coming,” Salvador exclainiees suddenly.
| . > “Another night wasted, you'll see.’

a “He'll come,” Amadito immediately replied, with
some impatience. “He put on his olive-green uniform. The adjutants were ordered to have the blue Chevrolet ready for him.
Why won’t you believe me? He'll come.”

Salvador and Amadito were in the back of the car parked
across from the Malecon, and they'd had the same exchange
several times during the half hour they had spent there. Antonio Imbert, at the wheel, and Antonio de la Maza, who sat beside him with his elbow out the window, made no comment
this time either. The four men were tense as they watched the
handful of vehicles driving from Ciudad Trujillo, their yellow
headlights piercing the darkness, on the way to San Cristobal.
None of the cars was the 1957 sky-blue Chevrolet with curtained windows that they were waiting for.

They were a few hundred meters from the Livestock Fairgrounds, where there were several restaurants—the Pony, the
most popular, was probably full of people eating grilled
meat—and some bars that had music, but the wind blew to the
east and the sounds did not reach them, though they could see
the distant lights through the palm trees. Yet the crash of
waves breaking against the rocks and the clamor of the undertow were so loud, they had to raise their voices to be heard.
The car, doors closed and lights off, was ready to pull away.

“Do you remember when we first started coming to the
Malecén to enjoy the breeze and nobody worried about the
caliés?” Antonio Imbert put his head out the window and filled
his lungs with the night air. “Here’s where we began talking
seriously about this.”

 

31
None of his friends answered right away, as if they were
consulting their memories or had not paid attention to what he
was saying.

“Yes, here on the Malecén, about six months ago,” Salvador
Estrella Sadhala replied after a while.

“Earlier than that,” Antonio de la Maza murmured without turning around. “In November, when they killed the Mirabal sisters, we talked about it here. ?m sure of that. And we’d
already been coming to the Malecén at night for a while.”

“It seemed like a dream,” Imbert mused. “Difficult, and a
long way off. Like when yourre a kid and imagine you'll be a
hero, an explorer, a movie star. Damn, I still can’t believe itll
be tonight.”

“If he comes,” Salvador grumbled.

“Tl bet anything you want, Turk,” Amadito repeated, full
of conviction.

“The thing that makes me wonder is that today’s Tuesday,”
Antonio de la Maza complained. “He always goes to San
Cristobal on Wednesday. You’re one of the adjutants, Amadito, and you know that better than anybody. Why did he
change the day?”

“T don’t know why,” insisted the lieutenant. “But he'll go.
He put on his olive-green uniform. He ordered the blue
Chevrolet. He'll go.”

“He must have a nice piece of ass waiting for him at Mahogany House,” said Antonio Imbert. “A brand-new one
that’s never been opened.”

“If you don’t mind, let’s talk about something else.” Salvador
cut him off.

“T always forget we can’t talk about asses in front of a saint
like you,” the man at the wheel apologized. “Let’s just say he
has something nice planned in San Cristdbal. Can I say it like
that, Turk? Or does that offend your apostolic ears too?”

But nobody was in the mood for jokes. Not even Imbert;
he talked only to fill the waiting time somehow.

“Heads up!” exclaimed De la Maza, craning his neck forward.

32
“It’s a truck,” replied Salvador, with a simple glance at the
approaching yellow headlights. “Pm not a saint or a fanatic,
Antonio. I practice my faith, that’s all. And ever since the bishops sent their Pastoral Letter on January 24 last year, Pm
proud to be a Catholic.” |
| In fact, it was a truck that roared past, its swaying load of

cartons tied down with ropes; its roar grew fainter and finally
disappeared.

“And a Catholic can’t talk about cunts but he can kill, is
that right, Turk?” Imbert tried to provoke him. He did it often: he and Salvador Estrella Sadhala were the closest friends in
the group; they were always trading jokes, at times so pointed
that others thought they would come to blows. But they had
never fought, their friendship was unbreakable. Tonight, however, Turk did not show a trace of humor:

“Killing just anybody, no. Doing away with a tyrant, yes.
Have you ever heard the word ‘tyrannicide’? In extreme cases,
the Church allows it. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that. Do you
want to know how I know? When I began to help the people
in June 14 and realized Pd have to pull the trigger someday, I
consulted with our spiritual adviser, Father Fortin. A Canadian
priest, in Santiago. He arranged an audience for me with Monsignor Lino Zanini, the papal nuncio. ‘Would it be a sin for a
believer to kill Trujillo, Monsignor? He closed his eyes and
thought. I could repeat his exact words, with his Italian accent.
He showed me the passage from St. Thomas, in the Summa
Theologica. If 1 hadn’t read it, I wouldn’t be here tonight with
all of you.”

Antonio de la Maza had turned around to look at him:

“You talked about this with your spiritual adviser?”

His voice was angry. Lieutenant Amado Garcia Guerrero
was afraid he would explode into one of those rages he had
been prone to ever since Trujillo had his brother Octavio
killed, years before. Outbursts like the one that was about to
destroy the friendship that united De la Maza to Salvador
Estrella Sadhala. But Salvador calmed him down:

33
“It was a long time ago, Antonio. When I began to help
June 14. You think I’m such an asshole that Pd confess something like this to a poor priest?”

“Turk, explain to me why you can say asshole and not ass,
cunt, or fuck,” Imbert joked, trying once again to ease the tension. “Don’t all dirty words offend God?”

“Words don’t offend God, only obscene thoughts,” Turk
replied in resignation. “Assholes who ask asshole questions
may not offend Him. But they must bore Him to death.”

“Did you take communion this morning so you’d come to
the great event with a pure soul?” Imbert continued the teasing.

“Pve taken communion every day for the past ten years,”
Salvador acknowledged. “I don’t know if my soul is the way a
Christian’s soul should be. Only God knows that.”

“Tt is,” thought Amadito. Of all the people he had known
in his thirty-one years, Turk was the one he admired most. Salvador was married to his aunt, Urania Mieses, whom Amadito
loved dearly. From the time he had been a cadet at Batalla de
Las Carreras Military Academy, whose director was Colonel
José Ledn (Pechito) Estévez, Angelita Truyillo’s husband, he
had spent his days off at the house of the Estrella Sadhalas. Salvador had become extremely important in his life; he confided
in him about his problems, troubles, dreams, and doubts, and
asked his advice before making any decision. The Estrella Sadhalas gave the party to celebrate Amadito’s graduation, carrying the sword of honor—first in a class of thirty-five
officers! —attended by his eleven maternal aunts, and, years
later, for what the young lieutenant thought would be the best
news he’d ever receive, his acceptance into the most prestigious
unit in the Armed Forces: the military adjutants responsible for
the personal safety of the Generalissimo.

Amadito closed his eyes and inhaled the salt-laden breeze
blowing in the four open windows. Imbert, Turk, and Antonio
de la Maza were quiet. He had met Imbert and De la Maza at the
house on Mahatma Gandhi, and that meant he had witnessed the

34
fight between Turk and Antonio, so violent he expected them
to start shooting, and, months later, he also witnessed the reconciliation of Antonio and Salvador for the sake of a single
goal: killing the Goat. No one could have told Amadito on
that day in 1959, when Urania and Salvador gave him a party
and countless bottles of rum were consumed, that in less than
two years, on a mild, starry night, on this Tuesday, May 30,
1961, he would be waiting for Trujillo in order to kill him. So
many things had happened since the day when, shortly after he
arrived at 21 Mahatma Gandhi, Salvador took him by the arm
and gravely led him to the most private corner of the garden.

“I must say something to you, Amadito. Because of the
fondness I have for you. That all of us in this house have for
you.” .

He spoke so quietly that the young man leaned his head
forward to hear him. |

“What's this about, Salvador?”

“It's about my not wanting to do anything to hurt your career. You may have problems if you keep coming here.”

“What kind of problems?”

Turk’s expression, which was usually serene, contorted
wach emotion. Alarm flashed in his eyes.

Im collaborating with the people in June 14. If anyone
finds out, it would be very dangerous for you. An officer in
Trujillo’s corps of military adjutants. Just think about it!”

The lieutenant never could have imagined Salvador as a clandestine conspirator, helping the people who had organized to
fight against Trujillo following Castro’s June 14 invasion at
Constanza, Maimon, and Estero Hondo, which had cost so
many lives. He knew that Turk despised the regime; Salvador
and his wife were careful in front of him, but sometimes they let
slip antigovernment remarks. Then they immediately fell silent,
for they knew that Amadito, though he had no interest in politics, professed, like any other officer in the Army, a blind, visceral loyalty to the Maximum Leader, the Benefactor and Father
of the New Nation, who for three decades had controlled the

35
destiny of the Republic and the lives and deaths of all Dominicans.

“Not another word, Salvador. You’ve told me. I heard it.
Pve forgotten what I heard. ’m going to keep coming here,
like always. This is my home.”

Salvador looked at him with the clear-eyed sincerity that
communicated a joyful sensation of life to Amadito.

“Let's go have a beer, then. Let’s not be sad.”

And, of course, when he fell in love and began to think
about marriage, the first people he introduced to his girlfriend,
after his Aunt Meca—his favorite among his mother’s eleven
sisters—were Salvador and Urania. Luisita Gil! Whenever he
thought of her, regret twisted his gut and anger boiled up inside him. He took out a cigarette and placed it in his mouth.
Salvador lit it for him with his lighter. The good-looking
brunette, the charming, flirtatious Luisita Gil. After some maneuvers, he had gone with two friends for a sail at La Romana.
On the dock, two girls were buying fresh fish. They struck up a
conversation and went with them to the municipal band concert. The girls invited them to a wedding. Only Amadito could
go; he had a day off, but his two friends had to return to barracks.He fell madly in love with the slender, witty little brunette
with flashing eyes, who danced the merengue like a star on the
Dominican Voice. And she with him. The second time they
went out, to a movie and a nightclub, he could kiss and hold
her. She was the woman of his life, he could never be with anybody else. The handsome Amadito had said these things to
many women since his days as a cadet, but this time he meant it.
Luisa took him to meet her family in La Romana, and he invited her to lunch at Aunt Meca’s house in Ciudad Trujillo, and

then, one Sunday, at the Estrella Sadhalas’: they were delighted

with Luisa. When he told them he was planning to ask her to
marry him, they were enthusiastic: she was a lovely woman.
Amadito formally asked her parents for her hand. In accordance
with regulations, he requested authorization to marry from the
commanding officers of the military adjutants.

36
It was his first clash with a reality that, despite his twentynine years, splendid grades, magnificent record as a cadet and
an officer, he had known nothing about. (“Like most Dominicans,” he thought.) The reply to his request was delayed. He
was told that the corps of adjutants had passed it along to the
SIM, so that they could investigate the person in question. In a
week or ten days he would have his approval. But the reply did
not come in ten, or fifteen, or twenty days. On the twenty-first
day the Chief summoned him to his office. It was the only time
he had exchanged words with the Benefactor even though he
had been close to him so often at public functions, the first
time this man whom he saw every day at Radhamés Manor had
directed his gaze at him.

From the time he was a child Lieutenant Garcia Guerrero
had heard, from his family—especially his grandfather, General
Hermogenes Garcia—at school, and later as a cadet and an officer, about Trujillo’s gaze. A gaze that no one could endure
without lowering his own eyes, intimidated and annihilated by
the force radiating from those piercing eyes that seemed to
read one’s most secret thoughts and most hidden desires and
appetites, and made people feel naked. Amadito laughed at the
stories. The Chief might be a great statesman whose vision,
wil, and capacity for work had made the Dominican Republic
a great country. But he wasn’t God. His gaze could only be the
gaze of a mortal man.

It was enough for him to walk into the office, click his
heels, and announce himself in the most martial voice his
throat could produce—“Second Lieutenant Garcia Guerrero,
at your service, Excellency!”—to feel electrified. “Come in,”
said the sharp voice of the man who sat at the other end of the
room behind a desk covered in red leather, writing and not
looking up. The young man took a few steps and stood at attention,
not moving a muscle or thinking, looking at the meticulously
groomed gray hair and impeccable attire—blue jacket and vest,
white shirt with immaculate collar and starched cuffs, silvery
tie secured with a pearl—and at his hands, one resting on a

37
sheet of paper that the other covered with rapid strokes of blue
ink. On his left hand he saw the ring with the precious iridescent stone, which, according to the superstitious, was an
amulet given to him when he was a young man, a member of
the Constabulary Guard pursuing the “bandits” who rebelled
against the United States’ military occupation, by a Haitian
wizard who assured him that as long as he kept it on he would
be invulnerable to enemies.

“A good service record, Lieutenant: ” he heard him say.

“Thank you very much, Excellency.”

The silver-colored head moved and those large staring
eyes, without brightness and without humor, met his. “Pve
never been afraid in my life,” the boy later confessed to Salvador. “Until that gaze fell on me, Turk. It’s true. As if he were
digging up my conscience.” There was a long silence while
those eyes examined his uniform, his belt, his buttons, his tie,
his visored hat. Amadito began to perspire. He knew that the
slightest carelessness in dress provoked such disgust in the
Chief that he could erupt into violent recriminations.

“A service record this good cannot be stained by marriage
to the sister of a Communist. In my government, friends and
enemies don’t mix.”

He spoke quietly, not releasing him from his penetrating
gaze. Amadito thought that at any moment the thin, highpitched voice would crack.

“Luisa Gil’s brother is one of the June 14 subversives. Did
you know that?”

“No, Excellency.” _

“Now you know.” He cleared his throat and added, without changing his tone: “There are a lot of women in this country. Find another one.”

“Yes, Excellency.”

He saw him make a gesture of assent, ending the interview.

“Permission to withdraw, Excellency.”

He clicked his heels and saluted. He left with a martial
step, hiding the anguish that paralyzed him. A soldier obeyed

38
orders, especially if they came from the Benefactor and Father
of the New Nation, who had taken a few minutes of his time
to speak to him in person. If he had given that order to him, a
privileged officer, it was for his own good. He had to obey. He
did, clenching his teeth. His letter to Luisa did not contain a
single word that was not true: “With a heavy heart, and
though I suffer because of it, I must renounce my love for you
and tell you, sadly, that we cannot marry. My superiors forbid
it because of your brother’s anti-Trujillista activities, something you hid from me. I understand why you did. But by the
same token I hope you also understand the difficult decision I
find myself obliged to make, against my will. I will always
think of you with love, but we will not see each other again. I
wish you good luck. Don’t be angry with me.”

Had the beautiful, happy, slender girl from La Romana
forgiven him? Though he hadn’t seen her again, he hadn’t replaced her in his heart. Luisa had married a prosperous farmer
from Puerto Plata. But if she eventually forgave him for breaking off their engagement, she never could have forgiven him
for the other thing, if she ever found out about it. He would
never forgive himself. And even if, in a few moments, the bullet-ridden body of the Goat were lying at his feet—he wanted
to empty his pistol into those cold iguana eyes—he would not
forgive him either. “At least Luisa will never know.” Not her,
not anybody except those who planned the ambush.

And, of course, Salvador Estrella Sadhal4; devastated by
hatred, alcohol, and despair, Lieutenant Garcia Guerrero had
come directly to his house at 21 Mahatma Gandhi, in the small
hours of that morning, from the brothel of Pucha Vittini, alias
Pucha Brazobdn, at the top of Calle Juana Saltitopa, where he
had been taken, afterward, by Colonel Johnny Abbes and Major Roberto Figueroa Carrion, so that with a few drinks and a
good piece of ass he could forget the unpleasantness. “Unpleasantness,” “sacrifice for the Fatherland,” “test of will,”
“blood offering to the Chief”: those were the things they had
said to him. Then they congratulated him for having earned a

39
promotion. Amadito took a drag of his cigarette and tossed it
onto the road: a tiny explosion of fireworks when it hit the asphalt. “If you don’t think about something else, you’re going
to cry,” he told himself, mortified at the thought that Imbert,
Antonio, and Salvador might see him burst into sobs. They
would think he was afraid. He clenched his teeth so hard it
hurt. He had never been as sure about anything as he was
about this. While the Goat lived, he would not, he’d be nothing but the ambulatory despair he had been since that January
night in 1961 when the world collapsed around him, and he
had run to 21 Mahatma Gandhi and taken refuge in Salvador’s
friendship so he wouldn’t put a gun in his mouth and pull the
trigger. He told him everything. Not night away. Because
when Turk opened the door, surprised at dawn by the pounding that roused him, his wife, and his children from bed and
from sleep, and found on the threshold Amadito’s broken sil_ houette reeking of alcohol, the young man could not say a
word. He opened his arms and threw them around Salvador.
“What is it, Amadito? Who died?” They took him to his bedroom, put him to bed, let him give vent to his feelings, babbling incoherently. Urania Mieses prepared mint tea that she
fed to him by the spoonful, as if he were a little boy.

“Don’t tell us anything you'll be sorry for,” Turk inter_ rupted.

Over his pajamas he wore a kimono with ideograms. He
sat at a corner of the bed, looking at Amadito with affection.

“Pll leave you alone with Salvador.” His Aunt Urania
kissed him on the forehead and stood up. “So you can talk
more freely, so you can tell him what it would make you sad to
tell me.”

Amadito thanked her. Turk turned off the overhead light.
The shade on the bedside lamp had a design that the light of
the bulb turned red. Clouds? Animals? The lieutenant thought
that if a fire broke out, he wouldn’t move.

“Go to sleep, Amadito. Things will seem less tragic in the
light of day.”

40
“It won't make any difference, Turk. Day or night Pll still
make myself sick. I¢ll be worse when I sober up.”

It began that afternoon, in the headquarters of the military
adjutants, next to Radhamés Manor. He had just returned
from Boca Chica, where Major Roberto Figueroa Carrion, liaison between the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Generalissimo Trujillo, had sent him to deliver a sealed envelope to
General Ramfis Trujillo at the Dominican Air Force Base. The
lieutenant entered the major’s office to report on his mission,
and Figueroa Carrion received him with a mischievous expression. He showed him the red file folder on his desk.

“Can you guess what I have here?”

“A week’s leave for me at the beach, Major, sir?”

“Your promotion to first lieutenant, boy!” His superior
happily handed him the folder.

“I stood there with my mouth open, because it wasn’t my
turn.” Salvador didn’t move. “I still have eight months before I
can apply for a promotion. I thought it was a consolation prize
because I was denied permission to get married.”

Salvador, at the foot of the bed, was ill at ease and made a
face.

“Didn’t you know, Amadito? Your friends, your superiors,
didn’t they tell you about the test of loyalty?”

“T thought they were just stories,” Amadito said with conviction, with fury. “I swear. People don’t bring that up, they
don’t brag about that. I didn’t know. It took me by surprise.”

Was that true, Amadito? One more lie, one more pious lie
in the string of lies that had been his life since he enrolled at the
Military Academy. Since his birth, for he had been born almost
at the same time as the Era. Of course you had to know, had to
suspect; of course, in the Fortress at San Pedro de Macoris, and
then, among the military adjutants, you had heard, intuited,
discovered, in the jokes and boasts, in the excited moments, the
bravado, that the privileged, the elect, the officers entrusted
with positions of greatest responsibility were subjected to a test
of loyalty to Trujillo before they were promoted. You knew

41
very well it existed. But now Second Lieutenant Garcia Guerrero also knew that he never had wanted to know in detail what
the test involved. Major Figueroa Carrién shook his hand and
repeated something he had heard so often he had begun to believe it:

“You'll have a great career, boy.”

He ordered him to pick him up at his house at eight that
night: they would go for a drink to celebrate his promotion,
and take care of a little business.

“Bring the jeep.” The major dismissed him.

At eight o’clock, Amadito was at his superiors house. The
major did not invite him in. He must have been watching at
the window, because before Amadito could get out of the jeep,
he appeared at the door. He jumped into the jeep, and without
responding to the lieutenant’s salute, he ordered, in a falsely
casual voice:

“To La Cuarenta, Amadito.”

“To the prison, Major, sir?”

“Yes, to La Cuarenta,” the lieutenant repeated. “You know
who was waiting for us there, Turk.”

“Johnny Abbes,” murmured Salvador.

“Colonel. Abbes Garcia,” AAR corrected him with
quiet irony. “The head of the SIM, yes.”

“Are you sure you want to tell me this, Amadito?” The
young man felt Salvador’s hand on his knee. “Won’t you hate
me afterward because you know that I know too?”

Amadito knew him by sight. He had seen him slipping like
a shadow along the corridors of the National Palace, getting out
of his black bulletproof Cadillac or climbing into it in the gardens of Radhameés Manor, entering or leaving the Chief’s office,
something that Johnny Abbes and probably nobody else in the
entire country could do—appear at any hour of the day or night
at the National Palace or the private residence of the Benefactor
and be received immediately—and always, like many of his
comrades in the Army, Navy, or Air Force, he had felt a secret
shudder of revulsion at that flabby figure stuffed into a colonel’s

42
uniform, the personified negation of the bearing, agility, martial air, virility, strength, and elegance that military men had to
display—the Chief said it every time he spoke to his soldiers on
the National Holiday and on Armed Forces Day—that fatcheeked, funereal face with the little mustache trimmed in the
style of Arturo de Cordoba or Carlos Lépez Moctezuma, the
most popular Mexican actors, and a capon’s dewlaps hanging
down over his short neck. Though they said so only among
their closest friends and after a good many glasses of rum, the
officers despised Colonel Johnny Abbes Garcia because he wasn’t a real soldier. He hadn’t earned his stripes the way they had,
by studying, going through the academy, living in barracks,
sweating to rise through the ranks. He had his as payment for
the undoubtedly dirty services he had rendered to justify his appointment as the all-powerful head of the Military Intelligence
Service. And they distrusted him for the grim acts that were attributed to him, the disappearances, the executions, the sudden
falls into disgrace of powerful people—like the recent plunge of
Senator Agustin Cabral—and for the terrible accusations, denunciations, and calumnies in the newspaper column “The Public Forum” that appeared every morning in El Caribe and kept
people in a state of anxiety because their fate depended on
whatever was said about them there, and for the intrigues and
the operations directed against sometimes apolitical and decent
people, peaceable citizens who had fallen somehow into the infinite nets of espionage that Johnny Abbes Garcia and his vast °
army of caliés spread into every corner of Dominican society.
Many officers— Lieutenant Garcia Guerrero among them—felt
authorized in their heart of hearts to despise this individual in
spite of the confidence the Generalissimo had in him, because
they thought, as did many men in the government, including,
apparently, Ramfis Trujillo himself, that Colonel Abbes Garcia’s undisguised cruelty brought the regime into disrepute and
justified its critics. And yet, Amadito recalled a discussion after a
dinner well watered by beer, among a group of military adjutants, when his immediate superior, Major Figueroa Carrion,

43
came to Abbes’s defense: “The colonel may be a devil, but he’s
useful to the Chief: everything bad is attributed to him and only
the good to Trujillo. What better service is there? For a government to last thirty years, it needs a Johnny Abbes who'll stick his
hands in shit. And his body and head, if he has to. He takes the
heat. Our enemies, and sometimes our friends, concentrate their
hatred on him. The Chief knows this, that’s why he keeps him
close. If the colonel didn’t watch the Chief's back, maybe the
same thing would have happened to him that happened to Perez
Jiménez in Venezuela, Batista in Cuba, Perdén in Argentina.”

“Good evening, Lieutenant.”

“Good evening, Colonel, sir.”

Amadito raised his hand to his visor and saluted, but
Abbes Garcia extended his hand—a hand as soft as a sponge,
wet with perspiration—and patted him on the back.

“Come this way.”

Near the sentry box crowded with half a dozen guards,
past the iron grillwork at the entrance, was a small room that
must have been used as an administrative office, with a table
and a couple of chairs. It was dimly lit by a single bulb dangling from a long cord covered with flies; a cloud of insects
buzzed around it. The colonel closed the door, pointed them
to the chairs. A guard came in with a bottle of Johnnie Walker
Red (“The brand I prefer because Juanito Caminante’s my
namesake,” the colonel joked), glasses, an ice bucket, and several bottles of mineral water. While he served the drinks, the
colonel talked to the lieutenant as if Major Figueroa Carrion
werent there.

“Congratulations on your new stripe. And that service
record. P’'m very familiar with it. The SIM recommended your
promotion. For distinguished military and civic service. T'll tell
you a secret. You’re one of the few officers denied permission
to marry who obeyed without requesting a review. That’s why
the Chief is rewarding you, moving your promotion ahead by
a year. A toast with Juanito Caminante!”

Amadito took a long drink. Colonel Abbes Garcia had

44
almost filled the glass with whiskey, with only a splash of water, and the liquid was like an explosion in his brain.

“At that point, in that place, with Johnny Abbes pouring
you a drink, didn’t you guess what was coming?” murmured
Salvador. The young man detected the grief flooding through
his friend’s words.

“That it would be hard and ugly, yes, Turk,” he replied,
trembling. “But never what was going to happen.”

The colonel poured another round. The three men had begun to smoke, and the head of the SIM spoke of how important it was not to allow the enemy within to raise his head, to
crush him every time he attempted to act.

“Because as long as the enemy within is weak and disunited, it doesn’t matter what the foreign enemy does. Let the
United States holler, let the OAS kick, let Venezuela and Costa
Rica howl, they can’t do us any harm. In fact, they unite Domunicans like a fist around the Chief.”

He had a thin drawling voice, and he avoided the eyes of
the person he was talking to. His eyes were small, dark, rapid,
evasive, moving constantly as if seeing things hidden from
other people. From time to time he wiped away sweat with a
large red handkerchief.

“Especially the military.” He paused to flick the ash from
his cigarette onto the floor. “And especially the military elite,
Lieutenant Garcia Guerrero. To which you now belong. The
Chief wanted you to hear this.”

He paused again, drew deeply on his cigarette, took a
drink of whiskey. Only then did he seem to discover that Major Figueroa Carrion existed:

“Does the lieutenant know what the Chief expects of him?”

“He doesn’t need anybody to tell him, he has more brains
than any officer in his class.” The major had the face of a toad,
and alcohol had accentuated and reddened his swollen features.
Amadito had the impression that their conversation was a rehearsed play. “I imagine he knows; if not, he doesn’t deserve
his new stripe.”

45
There was another pause while the colonel filled their glasses
a third time. He put in the ice cubes with his hands. “Salud” and
he drank and they drank. Amadito told himself he liked rum and
Coca-Cola a thousand times more than whiskey, it was so bitter.
And not until that moment did he understand the joke about
Juanito Caminante. “How dumb not to get it,” he thought. The
colonel’s red handkerchief was so strange! He had seen white,
blue, gray handkerchiefs. But red ones! What an idea.

“You're going to have greater and greater responsibilities,”
said the colonel, with a solemn air. “The Chief wants to be sure
youre up to the job.”

“What am I supposed to do, Colonel, sir?” All this
preamble irritated Amadito. “Pve always obeyed the orders of
my superiors. Pll never disappoint the Chief. This is a test of
loyalty, right?”

The colonel, his head lowered, was staring at the table.
When he looked up, the lieutenant noticed a gleam of satisfaction in those furtive eyes.

“It’s true, for officers with balls, Trujillistas down to the marrow of their bones, you don’t have to sweeten the pill.” He stood
up. “Youre right, Lieutenant. We'll finish our little piece of business and celebrate your new stripe at Puchita Brazoban’s place.”

“What did you have to do?” It was a struggle for Salvador
to speak; his throat was raw, his expression morose.

“Kall a traitor with my own hands. That’s how he said it:
‘And without your hands trembling, Lieutenant.’ ”

When they went out to the courtyard of La Cuarenta,
Amadito felt his temples throbbing. Beside a large bamboo
tree, next to the chalet that had been converted into a prison
and torture center for the SIM, near the jeep they had come in,
was another, almost identical jeep, its headlights turned off. In
the back seat, two guards with rifles flanked a man whose
hands were tied and whose mouth was covered by a towel.

“Come with me, Lieutenant,” said Johnny Abbes, getting
behind the wheel of the j jeep where the guards were sitting.
“Follow us, Roberto.”

As the two vehicles left the prison and took the coastal
highway, a storm broke, filling the night with thunder and
lightning. The violent downpour kept them from speaking.

. “Just as well it’s raining, even if we get wet,” the colonel re~ marked. “Irll break the heat. The campesinos were praying for
a little rain.”

He didn’t remember how long they drove, but it couldn’t
_ have been very long, because he did remember that when he
went into Pucha Vittini’s brothel after parking the jeep on
Calle Juana Saltitopa, the clock on the wall of the foyer was
striking ten. Everything, from the time he picked up Major
Figueroa Carrion at his house, had taken less than two hours.
Abbes Garcia drove off the highway, and the jeep bucked and
shook as if it were going to fall apart as they crossed a field of
tall weeds and stones, followed closely by the major’s jeep,
whose headlights lit the way. It was dark, but the lieutenant
knew they were moving parallel to the ocean: the sound of the
waves had grown so loud that it filled his ears. He thought
they were near the small port of La Caleta. As soon as the jeep
stopped, so did the rain. The colonel jumped down, followed
by Amadito. The two guards were well trained: without waiting for orders they pushed out the prisoner. In a flash of lightning the lieutenant saw that the gagged man wore no shoes.
. During the drive he had been absolutely docile, but as soon as
~ he touched the ground, as if finally aware of what was going to
happen, he began to twist, to roar, trying to loosen the ropes
and gag. Amadito, who until then had avoided looking at him,
observed the convulsive movements of his head as he attempted to free his mouth, say something, perhaps plead for
mercy, perhaps curse them. “Suppose I take out my revolver
. and shoot the colonel, the major, the two guards, and let him
run away?” he thought.

“Instead of one dead man on the rocks, there’d be two,”
said Salvador.

“Good thing it stopped raining,” Major Figueroa Carrion
complained as he climbed out. “P'm soaked, damn it.”

47
“Do you have your weapon?” asked Colonel Abbes Garcia.
_ “Don’t make the poor bastard suffer any more.”

Amadito nodded, not saying a word. He took a few steps
until he stood next to the prisoner. The soldiers released him
and moved away. The man did not start to run, as Amadito
thought he would. His legs would not obey him, fear kept him
nailed to the weeds and mud in the field, where a strong wind
blew. But though he did not attempt to escape, he continued
moving his head, desperately, right and left, up and down, in a
useless effort to get rid of the gag. He continued his choked
roaring. Lieutenant Garcia Guerrero put the barrel of his pistol
to the man’s temple and fired. The shot deafened him and
made him close his eyes for a second.

“Again,” said Abbes Garcia. “You never know.”

Amadito, bending over, touched the head of the man
sprawled on the ground—he was still and silent—and shot
again at point-blank range.

“That's it,” said the colonel, taking his arm and pushing him
toward the jeep of Major Figueroa Carrioén. “The guards know
what they have to do. Let’s go to Puchita’s and warm things up.”

In the jeep, driven by Roberto, Lieutenant Garcia Guerrero was silent, half listening to the conversation between the
colonel and the major. He remembered something they said:

“They'll bury him there?”

“They'll throw him in the ocean,” explained the head of the
SIM. “It’s the advantage of these rocks. On top, they’re sharp
as knives. Down below, there’s an entrance to the sea, very
deep, like a well. Full of sharks, waiting. They eat them in seconds. It’s really something to see. They leave no trace. Sure,
rapid, and clean, too.”

“Would you recognize the rocks?” Salvador asked.

No. All he remembered 1s that before they got there, they had
passed that small bay, La Caleta. But he could not reconstruct the
entire route from La Cuarenta.

“Tll give you a sleeping pill.” Salvador put his hand back
on his knee. “Youll sleep six, eight hours.”

48
“T haven’t finished yet, Turk. Be patient a little longer. So
you can spit in my face and throw me out of your house.”

They had gone to the brothel of Pucha Vittini, nicknamed
Puchita Brazoban, an old house with balconies and a dry garden, a place frequented by caliés, people connected to the government and the SIM, for whom, it was rumored, Pucha, a
foulmouthed, good-natured old woman, also worked, having
risen through the hierarchy of her trade to the rank of administrator and director of whores, after having been one herself in
the brothels on Calle Dos, starting very young and achieving
great success. She received them at the door and greeted
Johnny Abbes and Major Figueroa Carrion like old friends.
She grabbed Amadito’s chin: “What a sweetie pie!” She led
them to the second floor and sat them at a table near the bar.
Johnny Abbes asked her to bring Juanito Caminante.

“It took me a while to realize it was the whiskey, Colonel,
sir,” Amadito confessed. “Johnnie Walker. Juanito Caminante.
Easy, and I didn’t get it.”

“It’s better than any psychiatrist,” said the colonel. “Without
Juanito Caminante I couldn’t keep my mental equilibrium, the
most important thing in my work. To do it well, you need serenity, cold blood, icy balls. Never mix emotions with reason.”

There were no clients yet except for a little bald man with
eyeglasses who sat at the bar, drinking a beer. A bolero played
on the jukebox, and Amadito recognized the dense voice of
Tofia la Negra. Major Figueroa Carridn stood up and went to
dance with one of the women whispering in a corner under a
large poster for a Mexican movie with Libertad Lamarque and
Tito Guizar.

“You have steady nerves,” Colonel Abbes Garcia said approvingly. “Not all the officers are like you. [ve seen lots of
tough men fall apart at the critical moment. I’ve seen them shit
themselves in fear. Because even if nobody believes it, it takes
more balls to kill than to die.”

He poured the drinks and said, “Salud.” Amadito drank
greedily. How many drinks? Three, five, he soon lost all notion

49
of time and place. Besides drinking he danced with an Indian
girl whom he caressed and took into a little room lit by a bulb
covered in red cellophane swaying over a bed that had a
brightly colored quilt. He couldn’t fuck her. “Pm too drunk,
baby,” he apologized. The real reason was the knot in his
stomach, the memory of what ‘he had just done. Finally he
found the courage to tell the colonel and the major he was
leaving because he’d had too much to drink and felt sick.

The three of them walked to the door. There it was, waiting for Johnny Abbes, his black bulletproof Cadillac and his
chauffeur, and a jeep with an escort of armed bodyguards. The
colonel gave him his hand.

“Aren’t you curious to know who he was?”

“I prefer not to know, Colonel, sir.”

Abbes Garcia’s flabby face stretched into an ironic smile as
he wiped it with his fiery red handkerchief:

“How easy it would be if you could do these things without knowing who was involved. Don’t fuck with me, Lieutenant. If you jump in the water you have to get wet. He was
in June 14, the younger brother of your ex-girlfriend, I believe.
Luisa Gil, wasn’t it? Well, see you soon, we'll do some more
things together. If you need me you know where to find me.”

The lieutenant felt Turk’s hand on his knee again.

“Its a lie, Amadito.” Salvador tried to comfort him. “It
could have been anybody. He lied. To destroy you, to make
you feel more involved, more of a slave. Forget what he told
you. Forget what you did.”

_ Amadito nodded. Very slowly, he pointed at the revolver
on his belt.

“The next time I fire that, it will be to kill Trujillo, Turk,”
he said. “You and Tony Imbert can count on me for anything.
You don’t have to change the subject anymore when I come to
the house.”

“Heads up, heads up, this one’s coming straight toward
us,” said Antonio de la Maza, raising the sawed-off barrel to
the window, ready to fire.

50
Amadito and Estrella Sadhala gripped their weapons too.
Antonio Imbert started the engine. But the car coming down
_ the Malecén toward them, moving slowly, on the lookout, wasn’t the Chevrolet but a small Volkswagen. Using its brakes, until
the driver saw them. Then it made a U-turn and drove to where
they were parked. It stopped beside them, its headlights off.
