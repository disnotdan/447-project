When one of the military adjutants showed
Luis Rodriguez, Manuel Alfonso’s chauffeur,

“a= into the office, the Generalissimo stood to receive him, », something he did not do even with the most important
people.

“How is the ambassador?” he asked with concern.

“Just fair, Chief.” The chauffeur put on an appropriate expression and touched his own throat. “A lot of pain, again.
This morning he had me bring the doctor so he could give him
an injection.”

Poor Manuel. It wasn’t fair, damn it. That a man who had
devoted his life to caring for his body, to being handsome and
elegant, to resisting the perverse law of nature that everything
had to grow ugly, should be punished like this, where it would
most humiliate him: in the face that had radiated life, grace,
and health. He would have been better off dying on the operating
table. When he saw him in Ciudad Trujillo after his operation
at the Mayo Clinic, the Benefactor’s eyes had filled with tears.
Manuel had been ravaged. And he could hardly understand
him now that they had cut out half his tongue.

“Give him my best.” The Generalissimo examined Luis
Rodriguez; dark suit, white shirt, blue tie, polished shoes:
the best-dressed black in the Dominican Republic. “What's
the news?”

“Very good, Chief.” Luis Rodriguez’s large eyes flashed. “I
found the girl, no problem. Whenever you say.”

“Are you sure it’s the same one?”

The large dark face, with its scars and mustache, nodded
several times.

“Absolutely sure. The one who gave you flowers on Monday,

 

331
for the San Cristébal Youth Group. Yolanda Esterel. Seventeen
years old. Here’s her picture.”

It was a photograph from a student ID, but Trujillo recognized the languid eyes, the mouth with the plump lips, the hair
hanging loose to her shoulders. The girl had led the parade of
students, carrying a large photograph of the Generalissimo, past
the raised platform in the main park of San Cristébal, and then
came up on the dais to present him with a bouquet of roses and
hydrangeas wrapped in cellophane. He remembered her plump,
rounded body, her small breasts moving suggestively inside her
blouse, her flaring hips. A tingling in his testicles raised his spirits.

“Take her to Mahogany House, around ten,” he said, repressing those fantasies that were wasting his time. “My best
regards to Manuel. Tell him to take care of himself.”

“Yes, Chief, Pil tell him. Pll bring her there a little before

ten.”
He left, bowing. On one of the six telephones on his
lacquered desk, the Generalissimo called the guard post at
Mahogany House so that Benita Sepulveda would have the
rooms perfumed with anise and filled with fresh flowers. (It
was an unnecessary precaution, for the housekeeper, knowing
he might appear at any moment, always kept Mahogany
House shining, but he never failed to let her know ahead of
time.) He ordered the military adjutants to have the Chevrolet
ready and to call his chauffeur, aide-de-camp, and bodyguard,
Zacarias de la Cruz, because tonight, after his walk, he was going to San Cristdbal.

He was enthusiastic at the prospect. Could she be the
daughter of that school principal in San Cristébal who recited
a poem by Salomé Urefia ten years ago, during one of his political visits to his native city, and excited him so much with the
shaved armpits she displayed during her performance that he
left the official reception in his honor when it had just begun
and took her to Mahogany House? Terencia Esterel? That was
her name. He felt another gust of excitement imagining that
Yolanda was the teachers daughter or younger sister. He

332
walked quickly, crossing the gardens between the National
Palace arid Radhamés Manor, and hardly listened to what one
of the adjutants in his escort was telling him about repeated
calls from the Minister of the Armed Forces, General Roman
Ferndndez, who was at his disposal in the event His Excellency
wished to see him before his walk. Ah, the call this morning
had scared him. He’d be even more scared when he rubbed his
damn nose in it and showed him the puddle of filthy water.

He entered his rooms at Radhamés Manor like a whirlwind, His everyday olive-green uniform was waiting for him,
laid out on the bed. Sinforoso was a mind reader. He hadn’t
told him he was going to San Cristdbal, but the old man had
prepared the clothes he always wore to the Fundacién Ranch.
Why this everyday uniform for Mahogany House? He didn’t
know. The passion for rituals, for the repetition of gestures
and actions, that he’d had since he was young. The signs were
favorable: no urine stains on his underwear or trousers. His 1rritation with Balaguer for daring to object to the promotion of
Lieutenant Victor Alicinio Pefia Rivera had faded. He felt optmistic, rejuvenated by a lively tingle in his testicles and the expectation of holding in his arms the daughter or sister of that
Terencia of happy memory. Was she a virgin? This time he
wouldn’t have the unpleasant experience he’d had with the
skinny bitch.

He was glad he would spend the next hour smelling the
salt air, feeling the sea breeze, watching the waves break against
the Avenida. The exercise would help him wash away the bad
taste most of the afternoon had left in his mouth, something
that rarely happened to him: he had never been prone to depression or any of that bullshit.

As he was leaving, a maid came to tell him that Dona
Maria wanted to give him a message from young Ramfis, who
had called from Paris. “Later, later, I don’t have time.” A conversation with the tedious old penny-pincher would ruin his
good mood.

Again he crossed the gardens of Radhamés Manor at a

333
lively pace, impatient to get to the ocean. But first, as he did every day, he stopped at his mother’s house on Avenida Maximo
Gomez. At the entrance to Dofia Julia’s large pink residence,
the twenty or so men who would accompany him were waitIng, privileged persons who, because they escorted him every
evening, were envied and despised by those who had not
achieved that signal honor. Among the officers and civilians
crowded together in the gardens of the Sublime Matriarch,
who parted into two lines to let him pass, “Good afternoon,
Chief,” “Good afternoon, Excellency,” he acknowledged Razor
Espaillat, General José René Romdén—what concern in the
poor fool’s eyes!—Colonel Johnny Abbes Garcia, Senator
Henry Chirinos, his son-in-law Colonel Leén Estévez, his
hometown friend Modesto Diaz, Senator Jeremias Quintanilla,
who had just replaced Agustin Cabral as President of the Senate, Don Panchito, the editor of E/ Caribe, and, almost invisible
among them, the diminutive President Balaguer. He did not
shake hands with anyone. He went to the second floor, where
Dofia Julia usually sat in her rocker at dusk. The aged woman
seemed lost in her chair. As small as a midget, she stared at the
sun’s fireworks display as it sank behind the horizon in an aura
of red clouds. The ladies and servants surrounding his mother
moved aside. He bent down, kissed the parchment cheeks of
Dofia Julia, and caressed her hair tenderly.

“You like the sunset a lot, don’t you, Ma?”

She nodded, smiling at him with sunken but still nimble
eyes, and the tiny claw that was her hand brushed his cheek.
Did she recognize him? Dojfia Altagracia Julia Molina was
ninety-six years old and her mind must be like soapy water in
which memories dissolved. But instinct would tell her that the

man who came punctually to visit her every afternoon was

someone she loved. She had always been a very good woman,
this illegitimate daughter of Haitian immigrants to San
Cristobal, whose features he and his siblings had inherited,
something that never failed to mortify him despite his great
love for her. Sometimes, however, at the Hipddromo, the

334

we i ae cca Oa ans Relea RUS Sa EN ETI TS SE oR was _ so om
Country Club, or Fine Arts, when he saw all the aristocratic
Dominican families paying him homage, he would think mockingly: “They're licking the ground for a descendant of slaves.”

~ How was the Sublime Matrtarch to blame for the black blood

that ran in her veins? Dofia Julia had lived only for her husband,
Don José Trujillo Valdez, an easygoing drinker and womanizer,
and for her children, never thinking of herself, always putting
herself last in everything. He constantly marveled at this tiny
woman who never asked him for money, or clothes, or trips,
or property. Nothing, not ever. He had to force everything on
her. Congenitally frugal, Dofia Julia would have continued to
live in the modest little house in San Cristébal where the Generalissimo had been born and spent his childhood, or in one of
the huts where her Haitian ancestors had died of hunger. The
only thing Dofia Julia ever asked of him was compassion for
Petan, Blacky, Peepee, Anibal, his slow-witted, incorrigible
brothers, whenever they did something wrong, or for Angelita,
Ramfis, and Radhamés, who, from the time they were children,
had hidden behind their grandmother to soften their father’s
wrath. And Trujillo would forgive them, for Donia Julia’s sake.
Did she know that hundreds of streets, parks, and schools in the
Republic were named Julia Molina Widow of Trujillo? In spite
of being adored and celebrated, she was still the silent, invisible
woman Trujillo remembered from his childhood.

Sometimes he would spend a long time with his mother,
recounting the day’s events even if she couldn’t understand
him. Today he merely said a few tender words and returned to
Maximo Gomez, impatient to breathe in the scent of the
ocean.

As soon as he came out onto the broad Avenida—the cluster of civilians and officers parted again—he began to walk. He
could see the Caribbean eight blocks away, aflame with the
fiery gold of sunset. He felt another surge of satisfaction. He
walked on the right, followed by the courtiers who fanned out
behind him in groups that occupied the roadway and sidewalk.
At this hour traffic was prohibited on Maximo Gomez and the

335
Avenida, although, on his orders, Johnny Abbes had made the
security on the side streets almost invisible because intersections
crawling with guards and caliés eventually gave him claustrophobia. No one crossed the barrier of military adjutants a meter from the Chief. Everyone waited for him to indicate who
could approach. After halfa block, breathing in the perfume of
the gardens, he turned, looked for the balding head of
Modesto Diaz, and signaled to him. There was some confusion
because the fleshy Senator Chirinos, who was next to Modesto
Diaz, thought he was the anointed one and hurried toward the
Generalissimo. He was intercepted and sent back to the crowd.
For Modesto Diaz, who was very stout, keeping pace with
Trujillo on these walks cost him a great effort. He was perspiring profusely. He held his handkerchief in his hand and from
time to time wiped his forehead, his neck, and his fat cheeks.

“Good afternoon, Chief.”

“You have to go on a diet,” Trujillo advised. “Barely fifty
and you’re breathing hard. Learn from me, seventy years old
and in great shape.”

“My wife says the same thing every day, Chief. She fixes
chicken broth and salads for me. But I don’t feel like eating
that. I can give up everything except good food.”

His obese body could barely keep up with him.
Modesto, like his brother, General Juan Tomas Diaz, had a
broad face, flat nose, thick lips, and a complexion with unmistakable racial reminiscences, but he was more intelligent
than his brother and most of the other Dominicans Trujillo
knew. He had been president of the Dominican Party, a congressman, a minister; but the Generalissimo did not allow
him to stay too long in the government, precisely because
his mental acuity when expounding, analyzing, and solving a
problem seemed dangerous, something that could puff up his
pride and lead him to treason.

“What conspiracy has Juan Tomas gotten himself involved
in?” He asked the question and turned to look at him. “You
know what your brother and son-in-law are up to, I suppose.”

336
Modesto smiled, as if enjoying a joke:

“Juan Tomas? Between his estates and his businesses, his
whiskey and the movies he shows in his garden, I doubt he has
any time left for conspiracies.”

“He’s conspiring with Henry Dearborn, the Yankee diplomat,” Trujillo declared as if he had not heard him. “He should
stop that bullshit; he went through a bad time once and he can
go through another that’s even worse.”

“My brother isn’t fool enough to conspire against you,
Chief. But even so, Ill tell him.”

How pleasant: the sea breeze cleared his lings, and he
could hear the crash of waves breaking against the rocks and
the cement wall of the Avenida. Modesto Diaz made a move to
leave, but the Benefactor stopped him:

“Wait, I haven’t finished. Or can’t you take it anymore

“For you Id risk a heart attack.”

Trujillo rewarded him with a smile. He always liked
Modesto, who, in addition to being intelligent, was thoughtful, fair, affable, and unduplicitous. Still, his intelligence could
not be controlled and used, like Egghead’s, the Constitutional
Sot’s, or Balaguer’s. Modesto’s had an indomitable edge, an independence that could become seditious if he acquired too
much power. He and Juan Tomds were also from San
Cristdbal, he had known them since they were boys, and in addition to awarding him posts, he had used Modesto on countless occasions as an adviser. He had subjected him to rigorous
tests, and he had always come through successfully. The first
one came in the late forties, after Trujillo visited the Livestock
Show for pedigree bulls and dairy cows that Modesto Diaz organized in Villa Mella. What a surprise: his farm, not very
large, was as clean, modern, and prosperous as the Fundacién
Ranch. More than the impeccable stables and splendid cows, it
was Modesto’s arrogant satisfaction as he showed his breeding
farm to him and the other guests that wounded the Chiefs
sensibilities. The following day he sent the Walking Turd, with
a check for ten thousand pesos, to formalize the transfer of

337
ownership. Without the slightest hesitation at having to sell his
most prized possession at a ridiculously low price (just one of
his cows cost more), Modesto signed the contract and sent a
handwritten note to Trujillo expressing his gratitude that
“Your Excellency considers my small cattle-breeding enterprise
worthy of being developed by your experienced hand.” After
considering whether those lines contained some punishable
irony, the Benefactor decided they did not. Five years later,
Modesto Diaz had another large, beautiful ranch in a remote region of La Estrella. Did he think it was so far away it would go
unnoticed? Weak with laughter, he sent Egghead Cabral with
another check for ten thousand pesos, claiming he had so much
confidence in his cattle-raising talents that he was buying the
farm sight unseen. Modesto signed the bill of sale, pocketed the
symbolic sum, and thanked the Generalissimo in another affectionate note. To reward his docility, Trujillo subsequently
granted him the exclusive concession to import washing machines and electric mixers, which allowed the brother of General
Juan Tomas Diaz to recoup his losses.

“The mess with those shiteating priests,” Trujillo grumbled. “Does it have a solution or not?”

“Of course it does, Chief.” Modesto’s tongue protruded;
along with his forehead and neck, his bald head dripped perspiration. “But, if you'll permit me, the problems with the Church
don’t matter. They'll take care of themselves if the main issue is
resolved: the gringos. Everything depends on them.”

“Then there is no solution. Kennedy wants my head. Since
I have no intention of giving it to him, we'll be at war for a
long time.”

“It isn’t you the gringos are afraid of, Chief, but Castro.
Especially after the disaster at the Bay of Pigs. Now more than
ever they're terrified that Communism will spread through
Latin America. This is the moment to show them that the best
defense in the region against the Reds is you, not Betancourt
or Figueres.”

“They’ve had enough time to realize that, Modesto.”

338

“You have to open their eyes, Chief. The gringos are slow
sometimes. It’s not enough to attack Betancourt, Figueres, or
Mufioz Marin. It would be more effective to give some very
discreet help to the Venezuelan and Costa Rican Communists.
And the Puerto Rican independence movement. When
Kennedy sees guerrillas beginning to disrupt those countries,
and compares that to the peace and quiet we have here, he'll
get the idea.”

“We'll talk later.” The Generalissimo cut him off abruptly.

Hearing him talk about things in the past had a bad effect
on him. No gloomy thoughts. He wanted to maintain the
good mood he had when he started his walk. He forced himself
to think about the girl with the flowers. “Dear God, do this for
me. Tonight I need to fuck Yolanda Esterel nght. So I can
know I’m not dead. Not an old man. And can go on doing your
work for you, moving this damn country of assholes forward. I
don’t care about the priests, the gringos, the conspirators, the
exiles. I can clear away all that shit myself. But I need your help
to fuck that girl. Don’t be a miser, don’t be stingy. Give me
your help, give it to me.” He sighed, with the disagreeable suspicion that the one he was pleading with, if he existed, must be
observing him in amusement from the dark blue backdrop
where the first stars had begun to appear.

His route along Maximo Gémez simmered with memories.
The houses he was leaving behind were symbols of outstanding
people and events in his thirty-one years of power. Ramfis’s
house, on the lot where Anselmo Paulino’s had been; he had
been his right hand for ten years until 1955, when he confiscated all his property, kept him in prison for a time, then sent
him off to Switzerland with a check for seven million dollars
for services rendered. Across from the house of Angelita and
Pechito Leén Estévez had once stood the residence of General
Ludovino Fernandez, a workhorse who spilled a good deal of
blood for the regime; he was obliged to kill him when he succumbed to political inconstancy. Next to Radhamés Manor
were the gardens of the embassy of the United States, for more

339
than twenty-eight years a friendly house that had turned into a
nest of vipers. There was the field he had built so that Ramfis
and Radhamés could have fun playing baseball. There, like
twin sisters, stood Balaguer’s house and the nunciature, another building that had turned irritating, ungrateful, vile. And
beyond that, the imposing mansion of General Espaillat, his
former head of secret services. Facing it, a little farther on, was
the house of General Rodriguez Méndez, Ramfis’s companion
in dissipation. Then the embassies, deserted now, of Argentina
and Mexico, and the house of his brother Blacky. And, finally,
the residence of the Vicini family, the sugarcane millionaires,
with its vast expanse of lawn and well-tended flower borders,
which he was passing now.

As soon as he crossed the broad Avenida to walk along the
Malecén, right next to the sea, on his way to the obelisk, he
could feel the spatter of foam. He leaned against the wall,
closed his eyes, and listened to the shrieking and flapping
wings of flocks of seagulls. The wind filled his lungs. A purifying bath that would give him back his strength. But he mustn’t
be distracted; he still had work ahead of him.

“Call Johnny Abbes.”

Detaching himself from the cluster of civilians and military men—the Generalissimo was walking quickly toward
the cement column, a copy of the Washington Monument —
the inelegant, flaccid figure of the head of the SIM took his
place beside him. Despite his girth, Johnny Abbes Garcia kept
pace without difficulty.

“What's going on with Juan Tomas?” he asked, not looking at him.

“Nothing important, Excellency,” the head of the SIM
replied. “Today he went to his farm in Moca, with Antonio de
la Maza. They brought back a bull calf. The general and his
wife, Chana, quarreled because she said that cutting up and
cooking a calf is a lot of work.”

“Have Balaguer and Juan Tomas seen each other in the
past few days?” Trujillo interrupted.

340

 
Since Abbes Garcia did not answer immediately, he turned
to look at him. The colonel shook his head.

“No, Excellency. As far as I know, they haven’t seen each

other for some time. Why do you ask?”

“Nothing concrete.” The Generalissimo shrugged. “But
just now, in his office, when I mentioned Juan Tomas’s conspiracy, I noticed something strange. I felt something strange. I
don’t know what it was. Nothing in your reports to justify any
suspicions of the President?”

“Nothing, Excellency. You know I have him under surveillance twenty-four hours a day. He doesn’t make a move, he
doesn’t receive anyone, he doesn’t make a phone call without
our knowing about it.”

Trujillo nodded. There was no reason to distrust the puppet
president: his hunch could have been wrong. This plot didn’t
seem serious. Antonio de la Maza was one of the conspirators?
Another resentful man who consoled himself for his frustrations
with whiskey and huge meals. They'd be gorging on marinated
unborn calf this evening. Suppose he burst into Juan Tomas’s
house in Gazcue? “Good evening, gentlemen. Do you mind
sharing your barbecue with me? It smells so good! The aroma
reached all the way to the Palace and led me here.” Would their
faces be filled with terror or joy? Would they think that his unexpected visit marked their rehabilitation? No, tonight he’d go
to San Cristdbal, make Yolanda Esterel cry out, and feel
healthy and young tomorrow.

“Why did you let Cabral’s daughter leave for the United
States two weeks ago?”

This time Colonel Abbes Garcia really was surprised. He
saw him run his hand over his pudgy cheeks, not knowing how
to answer.

“Senator Agustin Cabral’s daughter?” he mumbled, playing
for time. .

“Uranita Cabral, Egghead’s daughter. The nuns at Santo
Domingo gave her a scholarship to the United States. Why did
you let her leave the country without consulting me?”

341
It seemed to him that the colonel was shrinking. He
opened and closed his mouth, not knowing what.to say.

“Tm sorry, Excellency,” he exclaimed, lowering his head.
“Your instructions were to follow the senator and arrest him if
he tried to seek asylum. It didn’t occur to me that the girl, having spent a night at Mahogany House and with an exit permit
signed by President Balaguer. . . The truth is, it didn’t even occur to me to mention it to you, I didn’t think it was important.”

“Those things should occur to you,” Trujillo berated him.
“I want you to investigate the personnel on my secretarial staff.
Somebody hid a memo from Balaguer about that girl’s trip. I
want to know who it was and why he did it.”

“Right away, Excellency. I apologize for this oversight. It
won't happen again.”

“T hope not,” and Trujillo dismissed him.

The colonel gave him a military salute (it made him want
to laugh) and rejoined the other courtiers. He walked a few
blocks without calling anyone; he was thinking. Abbes Garcia
had only partially followed his instructions to withdraw the
guards and caliés. At the corners he didn’t see the fortified wire
barricades, or the small Volkswagens, or the uniformed police
with submachine guns. But from time to time, at the intersections along the Avenida, he could detect in the distance a black
Beetle with the heads of caliés at the windows, or tough-looking
civilians leaning against lampposts, pistols bulging under their
armpits. Traffic had not been stopped along Avenida George
Washington. People leaned out of trucks and cars and waved
to him: “Long live the Chief!” Absorbed in the effort of the
walk, which had made his body deliciously warm and his legs a
little tired, he waved back his thanks. There were no adult
pedestrians on the Avenida, only ragged children, shoeshine
boys and vendors of chocolates and cigarettes, who looked at
him openmouthed. As he passed, he patted their heads or
tossed them some coins (he always carried change in his pockets). A short while later, he called the Walking Turd.

Senator Chirinos approached, panting like a hunting dog,

342
and perspiring more than Modesto Diaz. The Benefactor felt
encouraged. The Constitutional Sot was younger than he, and
a short walk demolished him. Instead of responding to his
“Good afternoon, Chief,” he asked:

“Did you call Ramfis? Did he give his explanations to
Lloyds of London?”

“T spoke to him twice.” Senator Chirinos was dragging his
feet, and the soles and ups of his misshapen shoes stumbled
over paving stones raised by the roots of ancient palms and almond trees. “I explained the problem to him and repeated
your orders. Well, you can imagine. But finally he accepted my
reasoning. He promised to write to Lloyds, clarify the misunderstanding, and confirm that payment should be transferred
to the Central Bank.”

“Has he done it?” Trujillo interrupted brusquely.

“That’s why I called him a second time, Chief. He wants a
translator to correct his telegram. His English is imperfect and
he doesn’t want mistakes. He'll send it without fail. He told
me he’s sorry about what happened.”

Did Ramfis think he was getting too old to obey him?
There was a time when he wouldn’t have put off following an
order of his with such a trivial excuse.

“Call him again,” he ordered, in a bad humor. “If he doesn't straighten out this business with Lloyds today, he’ll have to
deal with me.”

“Right away, Chief. But don’t worry, Ramfis has understood the situation.”

He dismissed Chirinos and resigned himself to finishing his
walk alone so as not to dash the hopes of others who yearned to
exchange a few words with him. He waited for his human train
and joined it, positioning himself with Virgilio Alvarez Pina and
the Minister of the Interior and Religious Practice, Paino
Pichardo. The group also included Razor Espaillat, the Chief of
Police, the editor of E/ Caribe, and the new President of the Senate, Jeremias (Monkey) Quintanilla, to whom he offered his
congratulations and best wishes for success. The man gleamed

343
with happiness as he poured out his thanks. At the same swift
pace, still walking east on the side of the street that hugged the
ocean, he asked, in a loud voice:

“Come, gentlemen, tell me the latest anti-Trujillista stories.”

A wave of faughter celebrated his witticism, and a few moments later they were all chattering like parrots. Pretending to
listen, he nodded and smiled. At times he caught sight of the
dejected face of General José René (Pupo) Roman. The Minister of the Armed Forces could not hide his anguish: what
would the Chief reproach him for? You'll find out soon
enough, imbecile. Moving from group to group so that no one
would feel overlooked, he crossed the well-tended gardens of
the Hotel Jaragua, where he heard the sounds of the orchestra
that played for cocktail hour, and a block after that he passed
under the balconies of the Dominican Party. Clerks and secretaries and the people who had gone there to ask for favors
came out to applaud him. When he reached the obelisk, he
looked at his watch: an hour and three minutes. It was growing dark. The gulls had stopped circling and had gone back to
their hiding places on the beach. A handful of stars were visible, but big-bellied clouds hid the moon. At the foot of the
obelisk, the new Cadillac, driven for the first time last week,
was waiting for him. He said a collective goodbye (“Good
evening, gentlemen, thank you for your company”) while, at
the same time, not looking at him, with an imperious gesture,
he pointed General José René Roman to the car door that the
uniformed chauffeur held open:

“You, come with me.”

General Roman—an energetic click of his heels, a hand at
the visor of his cap—quickly obeyed. He climbed into the car
and sat on the edge of the seat, very erect, his hat on his knees.

“To San Isidro, the base.” |

_ As the official car drove toward the center of the city in or_ der to cross to the eastern bank of the Ozama on the Radhamés |
Bridge, Trujillo contemplated the landscape, as if he were
alone. General Roman did not dare say a word, waiting for the

344
storm to break. It began to loom when they had covered about
three of the ten miles that separated the obelisk from the air
base.

“How old are you?” he asked, without turning to look at
him.

“T just turned fifty-six, Chief.”

Romdén—everyone called him Pupo—was tall, strong, and
athletic, with a very close crew cut. He played sports and maintained an excellent physique, without a trace of fat. He replied
very quietly, humbly, trying to placate him.

“How many years in the Army?” Trujillo continued, looking out the window, as if he were questioning someone who
wasrt there.

“Thirty-one, Chief, ever since my graduation.”

He allowed a few seconds to go by without saying anything. Finally he turned toward the head of the Armed Forces,
with the infinite contempt the man always inspired in him. In
the shadows, which had deepened rapidly, he could not see his
eyes, but he was sure that Pupo Roman was blinking, or had
his eyes half closed, like children when they wake at night and

squint fearfully into the darkness. |

“And in all those years you haven’t learned that a superior
answers for his subordinates? That he is responsible for their
mistakes?”

“I know that-very well, Chief. If you tell me what this is
about, perhaps I can give you an explanation.”

“You'll see what it’s about,” said Trujillo, with the apparent calm his collaborators feared more than his shouting. “You
bathe with soap every day?”

“Of course, Chief.” General Romdn tried to laugh, but
since the Generalissimo was still very serious, he fell silent.

“I hope so, for Mireya’s sake. I think it’s fine that you
bathe with soap every day, that your uniform is well pressed
and your shoes shined. As head of the Armed Forces you're
obliged to set an example of cleanliness and proper appearance
for Dominican officers and soldiers. Isn’t that true?”

345
“Of course it is, Chief.” The general groveled. “I beg you
to tell me how I’ve failed. So I can set things right and make
amends. I don’t want to disappoint you.”

“Appearance is the mirror of the soul,” Trujillo philosophized. “If somebody goes around smelling bad with snot running out of his nose, he isn’t a person who can be entrusted
with public hygiene. Don’t you agree?”

“Of course, Chief.”

“The same is true of institutions. What respect can you
have for them if they don’t even tend to their appearance?”

General Roman chose not to speak. The Generalissimo
had become more incensed and did not stop rebuking him for
the fifteen minutes it took to reach San Isidro Air Base. He reminded Pupo how sorry he had been when the daughter of his
sister Marina was crazy enough to marry a mediocre officer like
him, which he still was despite the fact that because of his relationship by marriage to the Benefactor, he had been promoted
to the very top of the hierarchy. These privileges, rather than
motivating him, had led him to rest on his laurels and betray
Truyillo’s confidence a thousand times over. Not content with
being the nonentity he was as an officer, he had taken up farming, as if you didn’t need brains to raise cattle and manage
lands and dairies. What was the result? He was drowning in
debt and was an embarrassment to the family. Barely eighteen
days ago he had personally paid with his own money the fourhundred-thousand-peso debt Roman had contracted with the
Agrarian Bank, so that the farm at kilometer fourteen on the
Duarte Highway would not be put up for auction. And despite
that, he made no effort to stop being a fool.

General José René Roman Fernandez remained mute and
motionless as the recriminations and insults poured down on
him. Trujillo did not rush; rage made him speak carefully, as if,
in this way, each syllable, each letter, would strike a harder
blow. The chauffeur drove at high speed, not deviating a millimeter from the center of the deserted highway.

“Stop,” Trujillo ordered a little before the first sentry post

346
along the fence that encircled the sprawling San Isidro Air
Base.

He jumped out, and despite the dark, he immediately
located the large puddle of pestilential water. Sewage was
still pouring out of the broken pipe, and in addition to mud
and filth, the air was thick with mosquitoes that rushed to
the attack.

“The leading military installation in the Republic,” Trujillo
said slowly, barely containing a new surge of rage. “Does it
seem right to you that at the entrance to the most important
air base in the Caribbean, the visitor 1s greeted by this stinking
shit pile of garbage, mud, and vermin?”

Roman squatted down. He inspected, stood up, bent
down again, did not hesitate to dirty his hands as he felt along
the sewage pipe, looking for the break. He seemed relieved to
discover the reason for the Chief’s anger. Had the idiot been
afraid of something more serious?

“Its a disgrace, no doubt about it.” He tried to display
more indignation than he felt. “ll take all necessary steps to
make certain the damage is repaired immediately, Excellency.
Pil punish those responsible, from top to bottom.”

“Beginning with Virgilio Garcia Trujillo, the commander
of the base,” the Benefactor roared. “You’re the first one responsible, and he’s the second. I hope you have the courage to
impose the most severe sanctions on him, even though he’s my
nephew and your brother-in-law. And if you don’t have the
courage, ll be the one who'll impose them on both of you.
Not you, not Virgilio, not any of you shitty little generals is
going to destroy my work. The Armed Forces will continue to
be the model institution I created, even if I have to throw you
and Virgilio and all the rest of you uniformed bunglers into jail
for the rest of your lives.”

General Romdn came to attention and clicked his heels.

“Yes, Excellency. It won’t happen again, I swear.”

But Trujillo had already turned and was climbing into the
car.

347
“Too bad for you if there’s any trace of what I’m seeing
and smelling now when I come back here. Fucking tin soldier!”

Turning to the chauffeur, he ordered: “Let’s go.” They
pulled away, leaving the Minister of the Armed Forces in the
mudhole.

As soon as he left Roman behind, a pathetic figure splashing in the muck, his bad temper vanished. He gave a little
laugh. He was sure about one thing: Pupo would move heaven
and earth and curse out everybody necessary to make sure the
pipe was repaired. If this kind of thing went on while he was
alive, what would happen when he could no longer personally
keep laziness, negligence, and imbecility from tearing down
what it had cost him so much effort to build up? Would anarchy and misery, the backwardness and isolation of 1930, return? Ah, if only Ramfis, the son he had longed for, were
capable of continuing his work. But he did not have the slightest interest in politics or the country; all he cared about was
booze, polo, and women. Fuck! General Ramfis Trujillo, head
of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Dominican Republic, playing polo and fucking the dancers at the Lido in
Paris while his father did battle here alone against the Church,
the United States, conspirators, and cretins like Pupo Roman.
He moved his head, trying to shake off those bitter thoughts.
In an hour and a half he would be in San Cristdbal, in the
peaceful refuge of the Fundacién Ranch, surrounded by fields
and gleaming stables, beautiful woods, the broad Nigua River,
whose unhurried movement through the valley he would observe through the tops of mahogany trees, royal palms, and the
great cashew tree by the house on the hill. It would do him
good to wake there tomorrow, stroking the sweet little body of
Yolanda Esterel as he contemplated the tranquil, unsullied
landscape. It was the prescription of Petronius and King
Solomon: a fresh little cunt to restore youth to a veteran of
seventy years.

At Radhamés Manor, Zacarias de la Cruz had already

348

i peak aire phasis ripmmimtaiin em te mrmemee’ oth .
taken out the light blue four-door 1957 Bel Air Chevrolet in
which he always drove to San Cristébal. A military adjutant
was waiting for him with the briefcase full of documents that
he would study tomorrow at Mahogany House, and 110,000
pesos in bills, for the ranch payroll, plus incidental expenses.
For twenty years he had not gone anywhere, even for a few
hours, without the dark brown briefcase with his engraved in1tials, and a few thousand dollars or pesos in cash for gifts and
incidental expenses. He indicated to the adjutant that he
should put the briefcase in the back seat and told Zacarfas, the
tall, husky black who had been with him for three decades—he
had been his orderly in the Army—that he would be right
down. Nine o’clock already. It was getting late.

He went up to his rooms to clean up, and as soon as he
walked in the bathroom, he saw the stain. On his fly and down
his leg. He felt himself trembling from head to foot: it had'to
happen now, damn it. He asked Sinforoso for another olive
green uniform and another change of underwear. He lost fifteen minutes at the bidet and sink, soaping his testicles, his penis, his face, and his armpits, and applying creams and
perfumes before he changed. His attack of bad humor,
brought on by that shiteating Pupo, was to blame. Again he
sank into a state of gloom. It was a bad omen for San
Cristébal. While he was dressing, Sinforoso handed him a telegram: “Lloyds matter resolved. Spoke with person in charge.
Remittance directly to Central Bank. Fond regards Ramfis.”
His son was ashamed: that’s why he sent a telegram instead of
calling him.

“We're a little late, Zacarias,” he said. “So step on it.”

“Understood, Chief.”

He leaned back against the cushioned seat and closed his
eyes, prepared to rest for the hour and ten minutes the trip to
San Cristébal would take. They were driving to the southwest,
toward Avenida George Washington and the highway, when
he opened his eyes:

“Do you remember Moni’s house, Zacarias?”

349
“On Wenceslao Alvarez, near where Marrero Aristy lived?”

“Let’s go there.”

It had been an illumination, a lightning flash. Suddenly he
saw Moni’s round little cinnamon-colored face, her curly mane
of hair, the mischief in her star-filled almond eyes, her compact
shape, high breasts, sweet ass with firm buttocks, voluptuous
hips, and again he felt the delicious tingling in his testicles. The
head of his penis woke up and brushed against his trousers.
Moni. Why not? She was a pretty, affectionate girl who had
never disappointed him, not since the time in Quinigua when
her father in person brought her to the party the Americans
from La Yuquera were holding for him: “Look at the surprise I
have for you, Chief.” The little house where she lived, in the
new development at the end of Avenida México, was his present to her on the day she married a boy from a good family.
When he required her, from time to time, he took her to one
of the suites at El] Embajador or El Jaragua that Manuel AlIfonso kept ready for such occasions. The idea of fucking Moni
in her own house excited him. They'd send her husband out
for a beer at Rincén Pony, as Trujillo’s guest—he laughed —or
he could pass the time talking to Zacarfas de la Cruz.

The street was dark and deserted, but a light was burning
on the first floor of the house. “Call her.” He saw the driver
walk through the front gate and ring the bell. It took a while
for anyone to answer. Finally, a maid must have come to the
door, and Zacarias spoke to her in whispers. He was left at the
door, waiting. Beautiful Moni! Her father had been a good
leader of the Dominican Party in Cibao, and he brought her to
the reception himself, a nice gesture. That was a few years ago
now, and the truth was that every time he fucked this goodlooking woman he felt very happy. The door opened again,
and in the light coming from the house he saw Moni’s silhouette. He felt another surge of excitement. After speaking for a
moment with Zacarias, she walked to the car. In the darkness
he couldn’t see what she was wearing. He opened the door to
let her in, and welcomed her with a kiss on the hand:

350
“You weren’t expecting a visit from me, beautiful.”

“Really, what an honor. How are you, Chief, how are you?”

Trujillo kept her hand between his. Feeling her so close,
touching her, inhaling her scent, he felt in control of all his
powers. |

“I was going to San Cristébal, but suddenly I thought of
you.”

“What an honor, Chief,” she repeated, flustered and confused. “If I had known, I would have fixed myself up to receive
you.”

“You're always beautiful, fixed up or not.” He pulled her
to him, and as his hands caressed her breasts and legs, he kissed
her. He felt the beginnings of an erection that reconciled him
with the world and with life. Moni let herself be caressed, and
she kissed him, with some restraint. Zacarias stood outside, a
few meters from the Chevrolet, on guard as always, holding a
submachine gun. What was going on? There was an edginess
in Moni that was unusual.

“Is your husband home?” —
“Yes,” she replied, in a quiet voice. “We were about to

“Have him go out for a beer,” said Trujillo. “Pll go around
the block. Pil be back in five minutes.”

“It’s just that . . . ,” she stammered, and the Generalissimo
felt her tensing. She hesitated, and finally she mumbled, almost
inaudibly: “I have the curse, Chief.”

All his excitement left him in a matter of seconds.

“Your period?” he exclaimed in disappointment.

“Please forgive me, Chief,” she stammered. “The day after
tomorrow I'll be fine.”

He let her go and sighed deeply, repulsed.

“All right, Pil come see you soon. Goodbye.” He leaned
his head toward the open door through which Moni had just
left. “We're leaving, Zacarias!”

A short while later he asked De la Cruz if he had ever
fucked a menstruating woman.

cat.

351
“Never, Chief.” He was shocked, and made a disgusted
face. “They say it gives you syphilis.”

“And worst of all, it’s dirty,” Trujillo lamented. What if
Yolanda Esterel, by some damn coincidence, had her period
today too?

They had taken the highway to San Cristobal, and on the
right he saw the lights of the Livestock Fairgrounds and the
Pony, crowded with couples eating and drinking. Wasn’t it
strange that Moni seemed so reluctant and inhibited? She was
usually so sassy, ready for anything. Did the presence of her
husband make her like that? Could she have invented a period
so he’d leave her alone? Vaguely he noticed that a car was
_ blowing its horn at them. Its brights were on.

“These drunks... ,” Zacarias de la Cruz remarked.

At that moment, it occurred to Trujillo that perhaps it wasn’t a drunk, and he turned to get the revolver he carried in the
back seat, but he couldn’t reach it, because at that moment he
heard the blast of a rifle whose bullets shattered the glass in the
back window and tore off a piece of his shoulder and his left
arm.

352
When one of the military adjutants showed
Luis Rodriguez, Manuel Alfonso’s chauffeur,

“a= into the office, the Generalissimo stood to receive him, », something he did not do even with the most important
people.

“How is the ambassador?” he asked with concern.

“Just fair, Chief.” The chauffeur put on an appropriate expression and touched his own throat. “A lot of pain, again.
This morning he had me bring the doctor so he could give him
an injection.”

Poor Manuel. It wasn’t fair, damn it. That a man who had
devoted his life to caring for his body, to being handsome and
elegant, to resisting the perverse law of nature that everything
had to grow ugly, should be punished like this, where it would
most humiliate him: in the face that had radiated life, grace,
and health. He would have been better off dying on the operating
table. When he saw him in Ciudad Trujillo after his operation
at the Mayo Clinic, the Benefactor’s eyes had filled with tears.
Manuel had been ravaged. And he could hardly understand
him now that they had cut out half his tongue.

“Give him my best.” The Generalissimo examined Luis
Rodriguez; dark suit, white shirt, blue tie, polished shoes:
the best-dressed black in the Dominican Republic. “What's
the news?”

“Very good, Chief.” Luis Rodriguez’s large eyes flashed. “I
found the girl, no problem. Whenever you say.”

“Are you sure it’s the same one?”

The large dark face, with its scars and mustache, nodded
several times.

“Absolutely sure. The one who gave you flowers on Monday,

 

331
for the San Cristébal Youth Group. Yolanda Esterel. Seventeen
years old. Here’s her picture.”

It was a photograph from a student ID, but Trujillo recognized the languid eyes, the mouth with the plump lips, the hair
hanging loose to her shoulders. The girl had led the parade of
students, carrying a large photograph of the Generalissimo, past
the raised platform in the main park of San Cristébal, and then
came up on the dais to present him with a bouquet of roses and
hydrangeas wrapped in cellophane. He remembered her plump,
rounded body, her small breasts moving suggestively inside her
blouse, her flaring hips. A tingling in his testicles raised his spirits.

“Take her to Mahogany House, around ten,” he said, repressing those fantasies that were wasting his time. “My best
regards to Manuel. Tell him to take care of himself.”

“Yes, Chief, Pil tell him. Pll bring her there a little before

ten.”
He left, bowing. On one of the six telephones on his
lacquered desk, the Generalissimo called the guard post at
Mahogany House so that Benita Sepulveda would have the
rooms perfumed with anise and filled with fresh flowers. (It
was an unnecessary precaution, for the housekeeper, knowing
he might appear at any moment, always kept Mahogany
House shining, but he never failed to let her know ahead of
time.) He ordered the military adjutants to have the Chevrolet
ready and to call his chauffeur, aide-de-camp, and bodyguard,
Zacarias de la Cruz, because tonight, after his walk, he was going to San Cristdbal.

He was enthusiastic at the prospect. Could she be the
daughter of that school principal in San Cristébal who recited
a poem by Salomé Urefia ten years ago, during one of his political visits to his native city, and excited him so much with the
shaved armpits she displayed during her performance that he
left the official reception in his honor when it had just begun
and took her to Mahogany House? Terencia Esterel? That was
her name. He felt another gust of excitement imagining that
Yolanda was the teachers daughter or younger sister. He

332
walked quickly, crossing the gardens between the National
Palace arid Radhamés Manor, and hardly listened to what one
of the adjutants in his escort was telling him about repeated
calls from the Minister of the Armed Forces, General Roman
Ferndndez, who was at his disposal in the event His Excellency
wished to see him before his walk. Ah, the call this morning
had scared him. He’d be even more scared when he rubbed his
damn nose in it and showed him the puddle of filthy water.

He entered his rooms at Radhamés Manor like a whirlwind, His everyday olive-green uniform was waiting for him,
laid out on the bed. Sinforoso was a mind reader. He hadn’t
told him he was going to San Cristdbal, but the old man had
prepared the clothes he always wore to the Fundacién Ranch.
Why this everyday uniform for Mahogany House? He didn’t
know. The passion for rituals, for the repetition of gestures
and actions, that he’d had since he was young. The signs were
favorable: no urine stains on his underwear or trousers. His 1rritation with Balaguer for daring to object to the promotion of
Lieutenant Victor Alicinio Pefia Rivera had faded. He felt optmistic, rejuvenated by a lively tingle in his testicles and the expectation of holding in his arms the daughter or sister of that
Terencia of happy memory. Was she a virgin? This time he
wouldn’t have the unpleasant experience he’d had with the
skinny bitch.

He was glad he would spend the next hour smelling the
salt air, feeling the sea breeze, watching the waves break against
the Avenida. The exercise would help him wash away the bad
taste most of the afternoon had left in his mouth, something
that rarely happened to him: he had never been prone to depression or any of that bullshit.

As he was leaving, a maid came to tell him that Dona
Maria wanted to give him a message from young Ramfis, who
had called from Paris. “Later, later, I don’t have time.” A conversation with the tedious old penny-pincher would ruin his
good mood.

Again he crossed the gardens of Radhamés Manor at a

333
lively pace, impatient to get to the ocean. But first, as he did every day, he stopped at his mother’s house on Avenida Maximo
Gomez. At the entrance to Dofia Julia’s large pink residence,
the twenty or so men who would accompany him were waitIng, privileged persons who, because they escorted him every
evening, were envied and despised by those who had not
achieved that signal honor. Among the officers and civilians
crowded together in the gardens of the Sublime Matriarch,
who parted into two lines to let him pass, “Good afternoon,
Chief,” “Good afternoon, Excellency,” he acknowledged Razor
Espaillat, General José René Romdén—what concern in the
poor fool’s eyes!—Colonel Johnny Abbes Garcia, Senator
Henry Chirinos, his son-in-law Colonel Leén Estévez, his
hometown friend Modesto Diaz, Senator Jeremias Quintanilla,
who had just replaced Agustin Cabral as President of the Senate, Don Panchito, the editor of E/ Caribe, and, almost invisible
among them, the diminutive President Balaguer. He did not
shake hands with anyone. He went to the second floor, where
Dofia Julia usually sat in her rocker at dusk. The aged woman
seemed lost in her chair. As small as a midget, she stared at the
sun’s fireworks display as it sank behind the horizon in an aura
of red clouds. The ladies and servants surrounding his mother
moved aside. He bent down, kissed the parchment cheeks of
Dofia Julia, and caressed her hair tenderly.

“You like the sunset a lot, don’t you, Ma?”

She nodded, smiling at him with sunken but still nimble
eyes, and the tiny claw that was her hand brushed his cheek.
Did she recognize him? Dojfia Altagracia Julia Molina was
ninety-six years old and her mind must be like soapy water in
which memories dissolved. But instinct would tell her that the

man who came punctually to visit her every afternoon was

someone she loved. She had always been a very good woman,
this illegitimate daughter of Haitian immigrants to San
Cristobal, whose features he and his siblings had inherited,
something that never failed to mortify him despite his great
love for her. Sometimes, however, at the Hipddromo, the

334

we i ae cca Oa ans Relea RUS Sa EN ETI TS SE oR was _ so om
Country Club, or Fine Arts, when he saw all the aristocratic
Dominican families paying him homage, he would think mockingly: “They're licking the ground for a descendant of slaves.”

~ How was the Sublime Matrtarch to blame for the black blood

that ran in her veins? Dofia Julia had lived only for her husband,
Don José Trujillo Valdez, an easygoing drinker and womanizer,
and for her children, never thinking of herself, always putting
herself last in everything. He constantly marveled at this tiny
woman who never asked him for money, or clothes, or trips,
or property. Nothing, not ever. He had to force everything on
her. Congenitally frugal, Dofia Julia would have continued to
live in the modest little house in San Cristébal where the Generalissimo had been born and spent his childhood, or in one of
the huts where her Haitian ancestors had died of hunger. The
only thing Dofia Julia ever asked of him was compassion for
Petan, Blacky, Peepee, Anibal, his slow-witted, incorrigible
brothers, whenever they did something wrong, or for Angelita,
Ramfis, and Radhamés, who, from the time they were children,
had hidden behind their grandmother to soften their father’s
wrath. And Trujillo would forgive them, for Donia Julia’s sake.
Did she know that hundreds of streets, parks, and schools in the
Republic were named Julia Molina Widow of Trujillo? In spite
of being adored and celebrated, she was still the silent, invisible
woman Trujillo remembered from his childhood.

Sometimes he would spend a long time with his mother,
recounting the day’s events even if she couldn’t understand
him. Today he merely said a few tender words and returned to
Maximo Gomez, impatient to breathe in the scent of the
ocean.

As soon as he came out onto the broad Avenida—the cluster of civilians and officers parted again—he began to walk. He
could see the Caribbean eight blocks away, aflame with the
fiery gold of sunset. He felt another surge of satisfaction. He
walked on the right, followed by the courtiers who fanned out
behind him in groups that occupied the roadway and sidewalk.
At this hour traffic was prohibited on Maximo Gomez and the

335
Avenida, although, on his orders, Johnny Abbes had made the
security on the side streets almost invisible because intersections
crawling with guards and caliés eventually gave him claustrophobia. No one crossed the barrier of military adjutants a meter from the Chief. Everyone waited for him to indicate who
could approach. After halfa block, breathing in the perfume of
the gardens, he turned, looked for the balding head of
Modesto Diaz, and signaled to him. There was some confusion
because the fleshy Senator Chirinos, who was next to Modesto
Diaz, thought he was the anointed one and hurried toward the
Generalissimo. He was intercepted and sent back to the crowd.
For Modesto Diaz, who was very stout, keeping pace with
Trujillo on these walks cost him a great effort. He was perspiring profusely. He held his handkerchief in his hand and from
time to time wiped his forehead, his neck, and his fat cheeks.

“Good afternoon, Chief.”

“You have to go on a diet,” Trujillo advised. “Barely fifty
and you’re breathing hard. Learn from me, seventy years old
and in great shape.”

“My wife says the same thing every day, Chief. She fixes
chicken broth and salads for me. But I don’t feel like eating
that. I can give up everything except good food.”

His obese body could barely keep up with him.
Modesto, like his brother, General Juan Tomas Diaz, had a
broad face, flat nose, thick lips, and a complexion with unmistakable racial reminiscences, but he was more intelligent
than his brother and most of the other Dominicans Trujillo
knew. He had been president of the Dominican Party, a congressman, a minister; but the Generalissimo did not allow
him to stay too long in the government, precisely because
his mental acuity when expounding, analyzing, and solving a
problem seemed dangerous, something that could puff up his
pride and lead him to treason.

“What conspiracy has Juan Tomas gotten himself involved
in?” He asked the question and turned to look at him. “You
know what your brother and son-in-law are up to, I suppose.”

336
Modesto smiled, as if enjoying a joke:

“Juan Tomas? Between his estates and his businesses, his
whiskey and the movies he shows in his garden, I doubt he has
any time left for conspiracies.”

“He’s conspiring with Henry Dearborn, the Yankee diplomat,” Trujillo declared as if he had not heard him. “He should
stop that bullshit; he went through a bad time once and he can
go through another that’s even worse.”

“My brother isn’t fool enough to conspire against you,
Chief. But even so, Ill tell him.”

How pleasant: the sea breeze cleared his lings, and he
could hear the crash of waves breaking against the rocks and
the cement wall of the Avenida. Modesto Diaz made a move to
leave, but the Benefactor stopped him:

“Wait, I haven’t finished. Or can’t you take it anymore

“For you Id risk a heart attack.”

Trujillo rewarded him with a smile. He always liked
Modesto, who, in addition to being intelligent, was thoughtful, fair, affable, and unduplicitous. Still, his intelligence could
not be controlled and used, like Egghead’s, the Constitutional
Sot’s, or Balaguer’s. Modesto’s had an indomitable edge, an independence that could become seditious if he acquired too
much power. He and Juan Tomds were also from San
Cristdbal, he had known them since they were boys, and in addition to awarding him posts, he had used Modesto on countless occasions as an adviser. He had subjected him to rigorous
tests, and he had always come through successfully. The first
one came in the late forties, after Trujillo visited the Livestock
Show for pedigree bulls and dairy cows that Modesto Diaz organized in Villa Mella. What a surprise: his farm, not very
large, was as clean, modern, and prosperous as the Fundacién
Ranch. More than the impeccable stables and splendid cows, it
was Modesto’s arrogant satisfaction as he showed his breeding
farm to him and the other guests that wounded the Chiefs
sensibilities. The following day he sent the Walking Turd, with
a check for ten thousand pesos, to formalize the transfer of

337
ownership. Without the slightest hesitation at having to sell his
most prized possession at a ridiculously low price (just one of
his cows cost more), Modesto signed the contract and sent a
handwritten note to Trujillo expressing his gratitude that
“Your Excellency considers my small cattle-breeding enterprise
worthy of being developed by your experienced hand.” After
considering whether those lines contained some punishable
irony, the Benefactor decided they did not. Five years later,
Modesto Diaz had another large, beautiful ranch in a remote region of La Estrella. Did he think it was so far away it would go
unnoticed? Weak with laughter, he sent Egghead Cabral with
another check for ten thousand pesos, claiming he had so much
confidence in his cattle-raising talents that he was buying the
farm sight unseen. Modesto signed the bill of sale, pocketed the
symbolic sum, and thanked the Generalissimo in another affectionate note. To reward his docility, Trujillo subsequently
granted him the exclusive concession to import washing machines and electric mixers, which allowed the brother of General
Juan Tomas Diaz to recoup his losses.

“The mess with those shiteating priests,” Trujillo grumbled. “Does it have a solution or not?”

“Of course it does, Chief.” Modesto’s tongue protruded;
along with his forehead and neck, his bald head dripped perspiration. “But, if you'll permit me, the problems with the Church
don’t matter. They'll take care of themselves if the main issue is
resolved: the gringos. Everything depends on them.”

“Then there is no solution. Kennedy wants my head. Since
I have no intention of giving it to him, we'll be at war for a
long time.”

“It isn’t you the gringos are afraid of, Chief, but Castro.
Especially after the disaster at the Bay of Pigs. Now more than
ever they're terrified that Communism will spread through
Latin America. This is the moment to show them that the best
defense in the region against the Reds is you, not Betancourt
or Figueres.”

“They’ve had enough time to realize that, Modesto.”

338

“You have to open their eyes, Chief. The gringos are slow
sometimes. It’s not enough to attack Betancourt, Figueres, or
Mufioz Marin. It would be more effective to give some very
discreet help to the Venezuelan and Costa Rican Communists.
And the Puerto Rican independence movement. When
Kennedy sees guerrillas beginning to disrupt those countries,
and compares that to the peace and quiet we have here, he'll
get the idea.”

“We'll talk later.” The Generalissimo cut him off abruptly.

Hearing him talk about things in the past had a bad effect
on him. No gloomy thoughts. He wanted to maintain the
good mood he had when he started his walk. He forced himself
to think about the girl with the flowers. “Dear God, do this for
me. Tonight I need to fuck Yolanda Esterel nght. So I can
know I’m not dead. Not an old man. And can go on doing your
work for you, moving this damn country of assholes forward. I
don’t care about the priests, the gringos, the conspirators, the
exiles. I can clear away all that shit myself. But I need your help
to fuck that girl. Don’t be a miser, don’t be stingy. Give me
your help, give it to me.” He sighed, with the disagreeable suspicion that the one he was pleading with, if he existed, must be
observing him in amusement from the dark blue backdrop
where the first stars had begun to appear.

His route along Maximo Gémez simmered with memories.
The houses he was leaving behind were symbols of outstanding
people and events in his thirty-one years of power. Ramfis’s
house, on the lot where Anselmo Paulino’s had been; he had
been his right hand for ten years until 1955, when he confiscated all his property, kept him in prison for a time, then sent
him off to Switzerland with a check for seven million dollars
for services rendered. Across from the house of Angelita and
Pechito Leén Estévez had once stood the residence of General
Ludovino Fernandez, a workhorse who spilled a good deal of
blood for the regime; he was obliged to kill him when he succumbed to political inconstancy. Next to Radhamés Manor
were the gardens of the embassy of the United States, for more

339
than twenty-eight years a friendly house that had turned into a
nest of vipers. There was the field he had built so that Ramfis
and Radhamés could have fun playing baseball. There, like
twin sisters, stood Balaguer’s house and the nunciature, another building that had turned irritating, ungrateful, vile. And
beyond that, the imposing mansion of General Espaillat, his
former head of secret services. Facing it, a little farther on, was
the house of General Rodriguez Méndez, Ramfis’s companion
in dissipation. Then the embassies, deserted now, of Argentina
and Mexico, and the house of his brother Blacky. And, finally,
the residence of the Vicini family, the sugarcane millionaires,
with its vast expanse of lawn and well-tended flower borders,
which he was passing now.

As soon as he crossed the broad Avenida to walk along the
Malecén, right next to the sea, on his way to the obelisk, he
could feel the spatter of foam. He leaned against the wall,
closed his eyes, and listened to the shrieking and flapping
wings of flocks of seagulls. The wind filled his lungs. A purifying bath that would give him back his strength. But he mustn’t
be distracted; he still had work ahead of him.

“Call Johnny Abbes.”

Detaching himself from the cluster of civilians and military men—the Generalissimo was walking quickly toward
the cement column, a copy of the Washington Monument —
the inelegant, flaccid figure of the head of the SIM took his
place beside him. Despite his girth, Johnny Abbes Garcia kept
pace without difficulty.

“What's going on with Juan Tomas?” he asked, not looking at him.

“Nothing important, Excellency,” the head of the SIM
replied. “Today he went to his farm in Moca, with Antonio de
la Maza. They brought back a bull calf. The general and his
wife, Chana, quarreled because she said that cutting up and
cooking a calf is a lot of work.”

“Have Balaguer and Juan Tomas seen each other in the
past few days?” Trujillo interrupted.

340

 
Since Abbes Garcia did not answer immediately, he turned
to look at him. The colonel shook his head.

“No, Excellency. As far as I know, they haven’t seen each

other for some time. Why do you ask?”

“Nothing concrete.” The Generalissimo shrugged. “But
just now, in his office, when I mentioned Juan Tomas’s conspiracy, I noticed something strange. I felt something strange. I
don’t know what it was. Nothing in your reports to justify any
suspicions of the President?”

“Nothing, Excellency. You know I have him under surveillance twenty-four hours a day. He doesn’t make a move, he
doesn’t receive anyone, he doesn’t make a phone call without
our knowing about it.”

Trujillo nodded. There was no reason to distrust the puppet
president: his hunch could have been wrong. This plot didn’t
seem serious. Antonio de la Maza was one of the conspirators?
Another resentful man who consoled himself for his frustrations
with whiskey and huge meals. They'd be gorging on marinated
unborn calf this evening. Suppose he burst into Juan Tomas’s
house in Gazcue? “Good evening, gentlemen. Do you mind
sharing your barbecue with me? It smells so good! The aroma
reached all the way to the Palace and led me here.” Would their
faces be filled with terror or joy? Would they think that his unexpected visit marked their rehabilitation? No, tonight he’d go
to San Cristdbal, make Yolanda Esterel cry out, and feel
healthy and young tomorrow.

“Why did you let Cabral’s daughter leave for the United
States two weeks ago?”

This time Colonel Abbes Garcia really was surprised. He
saw him run his hand over his pudgy cheeks, not knowing how
to answer.

“Senator Agustin Cabral’s daughter?” he mumbled, playing
for time. .

“Uranita Cabral, Egghead’s daughter. The nuns at Santo
Domingo gave her a scholarship to the United States. Why did
you let her leave the country without consulting me?”

341
It seemed to him that the colonel was shrinking. He
opened and closed his mouth, not knowing what.to say.

“Tm sorry, Excellency,” he exclaimed, lowering his head.
“Your instructions were to follow the senator and arrest him if
he tried to seek asylum. It didn’t occur to me that the girl, having spent a night at Mahogany House and with an exit permit
signed by President Balaguer. . . The truth is, it didn’t even occur to me to mention it to you, I didn’t think it was important.”

“Those things should occur to you,” Trujillo berated him.
“I want you to investigate the personnel on my secretarial staff.
Somebody hid a memo from Balaguer about that girl’s trip. I
want to know who it was and why he did it.”

“Right away, Excellency. I apologize for this oversight. It
won't happen again.”

“T hope not,” and Trujillo dismissed him.

The colonel gave him a military salute (it made him want
to laugh) and rejoined the other courtiers. He walked a few
blocks without calling anyone; he was thinking. Abbes Garcia
had only partially followed his instructions to withdraw the
guards and caliés. At the corners he didn’t see the fortified wire
barricades, or the small Volkswagens, or the uniformed police
with submachine guns. But from time to time, at the intersections along the Avenida, he could detect in the distance a black
Beetle with the heads of caliés at the windows, or tough-looking
civilians leaning against lampposts, pistols bulging under their
armpits. Traffic had not been stopped along Avenida George
Washington. People leaned out of trucks and cars and waved
to him: “Long live the Chief!” Absorbed in the effort of the
walk, which had made his body deliciously warm and his legs a
little tired, he waved back his thanks. There were no adult
pedestrians on the Avenida, only ragged children, shoeshine
boys and vendors of chocolates and cigarettes, who looked at
him openmouthed. As he passed, he patted their heads or
tossed them some coins (he always carried change in his pockets). A short while later, he called the Walking Turd.

Senator Chirinos approached, panting like a hunting dog,

342
and perspiring more than Modesto Diaz. The Benefactor felt
encouraged. The Constitutional Sot was younger than he, and
a short walk demolished him. Instead of responding to his
“Good afternoon, Chief,” he asked:

“Did you call Ramfis? Did he give his explanations to
Lloyds of London?”

“T spoke to him twice.” Senator Chirinos was dragging his
feet, and the soles and ups of his misshapen shoes stumbled
over paving stones raised by the roots of ancient palms and almond trees. “I explained the problem to him and repeated
your orders. Well, you can imagine. But finally he accepted my
reasoning. He promised to write to Lloyds, clarify the misunderstanding, and confirm that payment should be transferred
to the Central Bank.”

“Has he done it?” Trujillo interrupted brusquely.

“That’s why I called him a second time, Chief. He wants a
translator to correct his telegram. His English is imperfect and
he doesn’t want mistakes. He'll send it without fail. He told
me he’s sorry about what happened.”

Did Ramfis think he was getting too old to obey him?
There was a time when he wouldn’t have put off following an
order of his with such a trivial excuse.

“Call him again,” he ordered, in a bad humor. “If he doesn't straighten out this business with Lloyds today, he’ll have to
deal with me.”

“Right away, Chief. But don’t worry, Ramfis has understood the situation.”

He dismissed Chirinos and resigned himself to finishing his
walk alone so as not to dash the hopes of others who yearned to
exchange a few words with him. He waited for his human train
and joined it, positioning himself with Virgilio Alvarez Pina and
the Minister of the Interior and Religious Practice, Paino
Pichardo. The group also included Razor Espaillat, the Chief of
Police, the editor of E/ Caribe, and the new President of the Senate, Jeremias (Monkey) Quintanilla, to whom he offered his
congratulations and best wishes for success. The man gleamed

343
with happiness as he poured out his thanks. At the same swift
pace, still walking east on the side of the street that hugged the
ocean, he asked, in a loud voice:

“Come, gentlemen, tell me the latest anti-Trujillista stories.”

A wave of faughter celebrated his witticism, and a few moments later they were all chattering like parrots. Pretending to
listen, he nodded and smiled. At times he caught sight of the
dejected face of General José René (Pupo) Roman. The Minister of the Armed Forces could not hide his anguish: what
would the Chief reproach him for? You'll find out soon
enough, imbecile. Moving from group to group so that no one
would feel overlooked, he crossed the well-tended gardens of
the Hotel Jaragua, where he heard the sounds of the orchestra
that played for cocktail hour, and a block after that he passed
under the balconies of the Dominican Party. Clerks and secretaries and the people who had gone there to ask for favors
came out to applaud him. When he reached the obelisk, he
looked at his watch: an hour and three minutes. It was growing dark. The gulls had stopped circling and had gone back to
their hiding places on the beach. A handful of stars were visible, but big-bellied clouds hid the moon. At the foot of the
obelisk, the new Cadillac, driven for the first time last week,
was waiting for him. He said a collective goodbye (“Good
evening, gentlemen, thank you for your company”) while, at
the same time, not looking at him, with an imperious gesture,
he pointed General José René Roman to the car door that the
uniformed chauffeur held open:

“You, come with me.”

General Roman—an energetic click of his heels, a hand at
the visor of his cap—quickly obeyed. He climbed into the car
and sat on the edge of the seat, very erect, his hat on his knees.

“To San Isidro, the base.” |

_ As the official car drove toward the center of the city in or_ der to cross to the eastern bank of the Ozama on the Radhamés |
Bridge, Trujillo contemplated the landscape, as if he were
alone. General Roman did not dare say a word, waiting for the

344
storm to break. It began to loom when they had covered about
three of the ten miles that separated the obelisk from the air
base.

“How old are you?” he asked, without turning to look at
him.

“T just turned fifty-six, Chief.”

Romdén—everyone called him Pupo—was tall, strong, and
athletic, with a very close crew cut. He played sports and maintained an excellent physique, without a trace of fat. He replied
very quietly, humbly, trying to placate him.

“How many years in the Army?” Trujillo continued, looking out the window, as if he were questioning someone who
wasrt there.

“Thirty-one, Chief, ever since my graduation.”

He allowed a few seconds to go by without saying anything. Finally he turned toward the head of the Armed Forces,
with the infinite contempt the man always inspired in him. In
the shadows, which had deepened rapidly, he could not see his
eyes, but he was sure that Pupo Roman was blinking, or had
his eyes half closed, like children when they wake at night and

squint fearfully into the darkness. |

“And in all those years you haven’t learned that a superior
answers for his subordinates? That he is responsible for their
mistakes?”

“I know that-very well, Chief. If you tell me what this is
about, perhaps I can give you an explanation.”

“You'll see what it’s about,” said Trujillo, with the apparent calm his collaborators feared more than his shouting. “You
bathe with soap every day?”

“Of course, Chief.” General Romdn tried to laugh, but
since the Generalissimo was still very serious, he fell silent.

“I hope so, for Mireya’s sake. I think it’s fine that you
bathe with soap every day, that your uniform is well pressed
and your shoes shined. As head of the Armed Forces you're
obliged to set an example of cleanliness and proper appearance
for Dominican officers and soldiers. Isn’t that true?”

345
“Of course it is, Chief.” The general groveled. “I beg you
to tell me how I’ve failed. So I can set things right and make
amends. I don’t want to disappoint you.”

“Appearance is the mirror of the soul,” Trujillo philosophized. “If somebody goes around smelling bad with snot running out of his nose, he isn’t a person who can be entrusted
with public hygiene. Don’t you agree?”

“Of course, Chief.”

“The same is true of institutions. What respect can you
have for them if they don’t even tend to their appearance?”

General Roman chose not to speak. The Generalissimo
had become more incensed and did not stop rebuking him for
the fifteen minutes it took to reach San Isidro Air Base. He reminded Pupo how sorry he had been when the daughter of his
sister Marina was crazy enough to marry a mediocre officer like
him, which he still was despite the fact that because of his relationship by marriage to the Benefactor, he had been promoted
to the very top of the hierarchy. These privileges, rather than
motivating him, had led him to rest on his laurels and betray
Truyillo’s confidence a thousand times over. Not content with
being the nonentity he was as an officer, he had taken up farming, as if you didn’t need brains to raise cattle and manage
lands and dairies. What was the result? He was drowning in
debt and was an embarrassment to the family. Barely eighteen
days ago he had personally paid with his own money the fourhundred-thousand-peso debt Roman had contracted with the
Agrarian Bank, so that the farm at kilometer fourteen on the
Duarte Highway would not be put up for auction. And despite
that, he made no effort to stop being a fool.

General José René Roman Fernandez remained mute and
motionless as the recriminations and insults poured down on
him. Trujillo did not rush; rage made him speak carefully, as if,
in this way, each syllable, each letter, would strike a harder
blow. The chauffeur drove at high speed, not deviating a millimeter from the center of the deserted highway.

“Stop,” Trujillo ordered a little before the first sentry post

346
along the fence that encircled the sprawling San Isidro Air
Base.

He jumped out, and despite the dark, he immediately
located the large puddle of pestilential water. Sewage was
still pouring out of the broken pipe, and in addition to mud
and filth, the air was thick with mosquitoes that rushed to
the attack.

“The leading military installation in the Republic,” Trujillo
said slowly, barely containing a new surge of rage. “Does it
seem right to you that at the entrance to the most important
air base in the Caribbean, the visitor 1s greeted by this stinking
shit pile of garbage, mud, and vermin?”

Roman squatted down. He inspected, stood up, bent
down again, did not hesitate to dirty his hands as he felt along
the sewage pipe, looking for the break. He seemed relieved to
discover the reason for the Chief’s anger. Had the idiot been
afraid of something more serious?

“Its a disgrace, no doubt about it.” He tried to display
more indignation than he felt. “ll take all necessary steps to
make certain the damage is repaired immediately, Excellency.
Pil punish those responsible, from top to bottom.”

“Beginning with Virgilio Garcia Trujillo, the commander
of the base,” the Benefactor roared. “You’re the first one responsible, and he’s the second. I hope you have the courage to
impose the most severe sanctions on him, even though he’s my
nephew and your brother-in-law. And if you don’t have the
courage, ll be the one who'll impose them on both of you.
Not you, not Virgilio, not any of you shitty little generals is
going to destroy my work. The Armed Forces will continue to
be the model institution I created, even if I have to throw you
and Virgilio and all the rest of you uniformed bunglers into jail
for the rest of your lives.”

General Romdn came to attention and clicked his heels.

“Yes, Excellency. It won’t happen again, I swear.”

But Trujillo had already turned and was climbing into the
car.

347
“Too bad for you if there’s any trace of what I’m seeing
and smelling now when I come back here. Fucking tin soldier!”

Turning to the chauffeur, he ordered: “Let’s go.” They
pulled away, leaving the Minister of the Armed Forces in the
mudhole.

As soon as he left Roman behind, a pathetic figure splashing in the muck, his bad temper vanished. He gave a little
laugh. He was sure about one thing: Pupo would move heaven
and earth and curse out everybody necessary to make sure the
pipe was repaired. If this kind of thing went on while he was
alive, what would happen when he could no longer personally
keep laziness, negligence, and imbecility from tearing down
what it had cost him so much effort to build up? Would anarchy and misery, the backwardness and isolation of 1930, return? Ah, if only Ramfis, the son he had longed for, were
capable of continuing his work. But he did not have the slightest interest in politics or the country; all he cared about was
booze, polo, and women. Fuck! General Ramfis Trujillo, head
of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Dominican Republic, playing polo and fucking the dancers at the Lido in
Paris while his father did battle here alone against the Church,
the United States, conspirators, and cretins like Pupo Roman.
He moved his head, trying to shake off those bitter thoughts.
In an hour and a half he would be in San Cristdbal, in the
peaceful refuge of the Fundacién Ranch, surrounded by fields
and gleaming stables, beautiful woods, the broad Nigua River,
whose unhurried movement through the valley he would observe through the tops of mahogany trees, royal palms, and the
great cashew tree by the house on the hill. It would do him
good to wake there tomorrow, stroking the sweet little body of
Yolanda Esterel as he contemplated the tranquil, unsullied
landscape. It was the prescription of Petronius and King
Solomon: a fresh little cunt to restore youth to a veteran of
seventy years.

At Radhamés Manor, Zacarias de la Cruz had already

348

i peak aire phasis ripmmimtaiin em te mrmemee’ oth .
taken out the light blue four-door 1957 Bel Air Chevrolet in
which he always drove to San Cristébal. A military adjutant
was waiting for him with the briefcase full of documents that
he would study tomorrow at Mahogany House, and 110,000
pesos in bills, for the ranch payroll, plus incidental expenses.
For twenty years he had not gone anywhere, even for a few
hours, without the dark brown briefcase with his engraved in1tials, and a few thousand dollars or pesos in cash for gifts and
incidental expenses. He indicated to the adjutant that he
should put the briefcase in the back seat and told Zacarfas, the
tall, husky black who had been with him for three decades—he
had been his orderly in the Army—that he would be right
down. Nine o’clock already. It was getting late.

He went up to his rooms to clean up, and as soon as he
walked in the bathroom, he saw the stain. On his fly and down
his leg. He felt himself trembling from head to foot: it had'to
happen now, damn it. He asked Sinforoso for another olive
green uniform and another change of underwear. He lost fifteen minutes at the bidet and sink, soaping his testicles, his penis, his face, and his armpits, and applying creams and
perfumes before he changed. His attack of bad humor,
brought on by that shiteating Pupo, was to blame. Again he
sank into a state of gloom. It was a bad omen for San
Cristébal. While he was dressing, Sinforoso handed him a telegram: “Lloyds matter resolved. Spoke with person in charge.
Remittance directly to Central Bank. Fond regards Ramfis.”
His son was ashamed: that’s why he sent a telegram instead of
calling him.

“We're a little late, Zacarias,” he said. “So step on it.”

“Understood, Chief.”

He leaned back against the cushioned seat and closed his
eyes, prepared to rest for the hour and ten minutes the trip to
San Cristébal would take. They were driving to the southwest,
toward Avenida George Washington and the highway, when
he opened his eyes:

“Do you remember Moni’s house, Zacarias?”

349
“On Wenceslao Alvarez, near where Marrero Aristy lived?”

“Let’s go there.”

It had been an illumination, a lightning flash. Suddenly he
saw Moni’s round little cinnamon-colored face, her curly mane
of hair, the mischief in her star-filled almond eyes, her compact
shape, high breasts, sweet ass with firm buttocks, voluptuous
hips, and again he felt the delicious tingling in his testicles. The
head of his penis woke up and brushed against his trousers.
Moni. Why not? She was a pretty, affectionate girl who had
never disappointed him, not since the time in Quinigua when
her father in person brought her to the party the Americans
from La Yuquera were holding for him: “Look at the surprise I
have for you, Chief.” The little house where she lived, in the
new development at the end of Avenida México, was his present to her on the day she married a boy from a good family.
When he required her, from time to time, he took her to one
of the suites at El] Embajador or El Jaragua that Manuel AlIfonso kept ready for such occasions. The idea of fucking Moni
in her own house excited him. They'd send her husband out
for a beer at Rincén Pony, as Trujillo’s guest—he laughed —or
he could pass the time talking to Zacarfas de la Cruz.

The street was dark and deserted, but a light was burning
on the first floor of the house. “Call her.” He saw the driver
walk through the front gate and ring the bell. It took a while
for anyone to answer. Finally, a maid must have come to the
door, and Zacarias spoke to her in whispers. He was left at the
door, waiting. Beautiful Moni! Her father had been a good
leader of the Dominican Party in Cibao, and he brought her to
the reception himself, a nice gesture. That was a few years ago
now, and the truth was that every time he fucked this goodlooking woman he felt very happy. The door opened again,
and in the light coming from the house he saw Moni’s silhouette. He felt another surge of excitement. After speaking for a
moment with Zacarias, she walked to the car. In the darkness
he couldn’t see what she was wearing. He opened the door to
let her in, and welcomed her with a kiss on the hand:

350
“You weren’t expecting a visit from me, beautiful.”

“Really, what an honor. How are you, Chief, how are you?”

Trujillo kept her hand between his. Feeling her so close,
touching her, inhaling her scent, he felt in control of all his
powers. |

“I was going to San Cristébal, but suddenly I thought of
you.”

“What an honor, Chief,” she repeated, flustered and confused. “If I had known, I would have fixed myself up to receive
you.”

“You're always beautiful, fixed up or not.” He pulled her
to him, and as his hands caressed her breasts and legs, he kissed
her. He felt the beginnings of an erection that reconciled him
with the world and with life. Moni let herself be caressed, and
she kissed him, with some restraint. Zacarias stood outside, a
few meters from the Chevrolet, on guard as always, holding a
submachine gun. What was going on? There was an edginess
in Moni that was unusual.

“Is your husband home?” —
“Yes,” she replied, in a quiet voice. “We were about to

“Have him go out for a beer,” said Trujillo. “Pll go around
the block. Pil be back in five minutes.”

“It’s just that . . . ,” she stammered, and the Generalissimo
felt her tensing. She hesitated, and finally she mumbled, almost
inaudibly: “I have the curse, Chief.”

All his excitement left him in a matter of seconds.

“Your period?” he exclaimed in disappointment.

“Please forgive me, Chief,” she stammered. “The day after
tomorrow I'll be fine.”

He let her go and sighed deeply, repulsed.

“All right, Pil come see you soon. Goodbye.” He leaned
his head toward the open door through which Moni had just
left. “We're leaving, Zacarias!”

A short while later he asked De la Cruz if he had ever
fucked a menstruating woman.

cat.

351
“Never, Chief.” He was shocked, and made a disgusted
face. “They say it gives you syphilis.”

“And worst of all, it’s dirty,” Trujillo lamented. What if
Yolanda Esterel, by some damn coincidence, had her period
today too?

They had taken the highway to San Cristobal, and on the
right he saw the lights of the Livestock Fairgrounds and the
Pony, crowded with couples eating and drinking. Wasn’t it
strange that Moni seemed so reluctant and inhibited? She was
usually so sassy, ready for anything. Did the presence of her
husband make her like that? Could she have invented a period
so he’d leave her alone? Vaguely he noticed that a car was
_ blowing its horn at them. Its brights were on.

“These drunks... ,” Zacarias de la Cruz remarked.

At that moment, it occurred to Trujillo that perhaps it wasn’t a drunk, and he turned to get the revolver he carried in the
back seat, but he couldn’t reach it, because at that moment he
heard the blast of a rifle whose bullets shattered the glass in the
back window and tore off a piece of his shoulder and his left
arm.

352
