“Aren’t you going up to see him?” the nurse says at last.
, Urania knows the question has been struggling to
[= pass the woman’s lips ever since she came into the little house on César Nicolas Penson, but instead of asking the
nurse to take her to Sefior Cabral’s room, she went to the
kitchen and fixed herself some coffee. She has been sipping it
for the past ten minutes.

“First Pll finish my breakfast,” she answers, not smiling,
and the nurse lowers her eyes in confusion. “I need strength to
climb those stairs.”

“I know there was trouble between you and him, I heard
something about it,” the woman apologizes, not knowing
what to do with her hands. “I was just asking. I already gave
him his breakfast and shaved him. He always wakes up very
early.”

Urania nods. She feels calm and confident now. Again she
examines the decay around her. The paint on the walls has deteriorated, and the tabletop, the sink, the cupboard, everything
looks smaller and misaligned. Was it the same furniture? She
didn’t recognize anything.

“Does anyone come to visit him? Anybody in the family, I
mean.”

“Sefiora Adelina’s daughters, Sefiora Lucindita and Sefiora
Manolita, always come about noon.” The woman—tall, no
longer young, wearing slacks under her white uniform—stands
in the kitchen doorway and does not hide her discomfort.
“Your aunt used to come every day. But since she broke her
hip, she doesn’t go out anymore.”

Aunt Adelina was a good deal younger than her father, she
couldn’t be more than seventy-five. So she broke her hip. Was

 

52
she still so devout? She took communion every day, back then.

“Is he in his bedroom?” Urania drinks the last of her coffee. “Well, where else would he be?. No, don’t come up with
me.”

She climbs the staircase with the discolored railing where,
she remembers, pots filled with flowers used to hang, and she
can’t shake the feeling that the house has shrunk. When she
reaches the upper floor, she notices the chipped tiles, some of
them loose. This had been a modern house, comfortable, furnished with taste; it has fallen on hard times, it’s a hovel compared to the houses and condominiums she saw the night
before in Bella Vista. She stops at the first door—this used to be
his room—and before she goes in, she knocks a couple of times.

She is greeted by intense light that pours through the
wide-open window. The glare blinds her for a few seconds;
then she begins to make out the bed covered by a gray
spread, the old bureau with its oval mirror, the photographs
on the walls—how did he get hold of her graduation picture
from Harvard? —and, finally, in the old leather chair with its
broad back and arms, an old man in blue pajamas and slippers. He looks dwarfed by the chair. He has grown wrinkled
_ and smaller, just like the house. She is distracted by a white
object at her father’s feet, a small chamber pot, half filled with
urine. “

Back then his hair was black except for some distinguished
gray at his temples; now the sparse hairs on his bald head are
yellowish, dirty. His eyes were large, sure of themselves, masters of the world (when he wasn’t near the Chief); but these
two slits staring at her are tiny, beady, frightened. He had teeth
and now he doesn’t; he can’t be wearing his dentures (she paid
the bill for them a few years ago), because his lips have collapsed and his cheeks are so sunken they almost touch. He has
shriveled, his feet barely touch the floor. To look at him she
used to have to raise her head, stretch her neck; now, if he were
to stand up, he would reach her shoulder.

“Its Urania,” she murmurs, approaching him. She sits on

53
the bed, a meter from her father. “Do you remember that you
have a daughter?”

There is internal agitation in the old man, movements of
the pale bony hands with tapered fingers that rest on his legs.
But the narrow little eyes, although they don’t move away
from Urania, remain unexpressive.

“I don’t recognize you either,” Urania whispers. “I don’t
know why I came or what I’m doing here.”

The old man has begun to move his head, up and down,
down and up. His throat emits a long, harsh, strangled moan,
like a lugubrious song. But in a few moments he is calm again,
his eyes still fixed on her.

“The house used to be full of books.” Urania glances at the
bare walls. “What happened to them? Of course, you can’t read
anymore. Did you have time to read back then? I don’t remember ever seeing you read. You were a busy man. I’m busy too
now, maybe even more than you in those days. Ten, twelve
hours in the office or visiting clients. But I make time to read a
little every day. Early in the morning, watching the sun come up
behind the Manhattan skyscrapers, or late at night, looking at
the lights in those glass beehives. I really like it. On Sundays I
read for three or four hours, after Meet the Press. The advantage
of being single, Papa. You knew that, didn’t you? Your hittle girl
was left behind to dress the saints. That’s what you used to say
about unmarried women: ‘What a failure! She never caught a
husband!’ Neither did I, Papa. Or rather, I didn’t want to. I had
offers. At the university. At the World Bank. At the office. Just
think, a boyfriend may still turn up. At the age of forty-nine! It
isn’t so terrible being an old maid. For one thing, I have time to
read instead of taking care of a husband and children.”

He seems to understand, to be so interested he doesn’t
dare move a muscle in case he interrupts her. He sits very still,
his narrow chest rising and falling rhythmically, his tiny eyes
focused on her lips. Outside an occasional car passes, and footsteps, voices, snatches of conversation approach, nise, fall, and
are lost in the distance.

54
“My apartment in Manhattan is full of books,” Urania continues. “Like this house when I was a girl. Law, economy, history. But in my bedroom, only Dominican books.
Testimonies, essays, memoirs, lots of histories. Can you guess
the period? The Trujillo Era, what else? The most important
thing that happened to us in five hundred years. You used to
say that with so much conviction. It’s true, Papa. During those
thirty-one years, all the evil we had carried with us since the
Conquest became crystallized. You’re in some of those books,
an important figure. Minister of Foreign Affairs, senator, president of the Dominican Party. Is there anything you weren’t,
Papa? Pve become an expert on Trujillo. Instead of playing
bridge or golf, or riding horses, or going to the opera, my
hobby has been finding out what happened during those years.
Its a shame we can’t have a conversation. You could clarify so
many things for me, you lived them arm in arm with your
beloved Chief, who repaid your loyalty so shabbily. For instance, I would have liked for you to tell me if His Excellency
also took my mother to bed.”

She sees that the old man is shaken. His fragile, shrunken
body has given a start in the chair. Urania moves her head
closer and observes him. Is it a false impression? He seems to
be listening, making an effort to understand what she is saying.

“Did you allow it? Resign yourself to it? Use it to further
your career?”

Urania takes a deep breath. She examines the room. There
are two photographs in silver frames on the night table. Her
first communion, the year her mother died. Perhaps she left
this world with a vision of her little girl enveloped in the tulle
of that beautiful dress, with that angelic look. The other photo
is of her mother: young, black hair parted in the middle, eyebrows tweezed, eyes melancholy and dreamy. It’s an old, yellowing photograph, slightly creased. She goes to the night
table, raises the photograph to her lips, and kisses it.

She hears a car braking at the front door. Her heart skips a
beat; without moving from her place, she can see, through the

55
curtains, the sparkling chrome, the gleaming body, the flashing
brilliance of the luxurious automobile. She hears footsteps, the
doorbell chimes two or three times, and—hypnotized, petrified, not moving—she hears the maid opening the door. She
hears but doesn’t understand the brief conversation at the foot
of the stairs. Her madly beating heart is about to explode. Taps
on the door. An Indian girl, wearing a maid’s uniform, her expression terrified, looks in the half-opened door:

“The President has come to visit you, sefiora. The Generalissimo, senora!”

“Tell him I’m sorry but I can’t receive him. Tell him Sefiora
de Cabral does not receive visitors when Agustin is not at
home. Go on, tell him.”

The girl’s footsteps move away, timid, indecisive, going
down the staircase with the railing where flowerpots hang,
ablaze with geraniums. Urania replaces her mother’s photograph on the nightstand and returns to the corner of the bed.
Trapped in the chair, her father looks at her in alarm.

“That’s what the Chief did to his Minister of Education,
early in his government, and you know all about it, Papa.
What he did to the young scholar, Don Pedro Henriquez
Urefia, a refined, genial man. He came to see his wife while
Don Pedro was at work. She was brave enough to tell him she
didn’t receive visitors when her husband wasn’t home. At the
beginning of the Era it was still possible for a woman to refuse
to receive the Chief. When she told him what had happened,
Don Pedro resigned, left the country, and never set foot on
this island again. Which is why he became so famous as a ~
teacher, a historian, a critic, a philologist, in Mexico, Argentina,
and Spain. Lucky for him the Chief wanted to go to bed with
his wife. In those early days, a minister could resign and not
have an accident, or fall off a cliff, or be stabbed by a madman,
or eaten by sharks. He did the right thing, don’t you agree?
His action saved him from becoming what you became, Papa.
Would you have done the same thing or looked away? Like
your hated good friend, your despised dear colleague, our

56
neighbor Don Froilan. Do you remember, Papa?”

The old man begins to tremble and moan that macabre
song. Urania waits until he settles down. Don Froilan! He
would whisper in the living room, on the terrace or in the garden with her father, whom he came to see several times a day
during the periods when they were allies in the internecine
struggles among the Trujillista factions, battles the Benefactor
encouraged in order to neutralize his collaborators by keeping
them busy protecting their backs from the knives of enemies
who were, in public, their friends, brothers, and fellow believers. Don Froildn lived in the house across the way; on its tiled
roof there are, at this very moment, a row of half a dozen pigeons standing at attention. Urania goes to the window. It
hasn’t changed much either, the house of that powerful man
who was also a minister, senator, intendant, chancellor, ambassador, everything one could be during those years. Even Minister of Foreign Affairs, in May 1961, when the great events
took place. :

The house is still painted gray and white, but it too has
grown smaller. An extension of four or five meters has been
built on, out of harmony with the projecting pointed arch at
the entrance in the style of a Gothic castle, where she often
saw, on her way home from school in the afternoons, the elegant figure of Don Froilan’s wife. As soon as the woman saw
her she would call: “Urania, Uranita! Come here, let me look
at you, darling. What eyes, my girl! You're as pretty as your
mother, Uranita.” She would stroke her hair with carefully
manicured hands, the long nails painted a deep red. Urania
would feel so dreamy when those fingers moved through her
hair and caressed her scalp. Eugenia? Laura? Did she have a
flower name? Magnolia? She’s forgotten. But not her face, her
snowy skin, silken eyes, regal figure. She always seemed to be
dressed for a party. Urania loved her because she was so affectionate, because she gave her gifts and took her to the Country
Club to swim in the pool, and, above all, because she had been
her mother’s friend. She imagined that if she hadn’t gone to

57
heaven, her mother would be as beautiful and aristocratic as
Don Froilan’s wife. There was nothing attractive about him,
however. Short, bald, fat: no woman would have looked at
him twice. Was it the need to find a husband or self-interest
that made her marry him?

This is what she asks herself in bewilderment as she opens
the box of chocolates, wrapped in metallic paper, that the lady
has given her, with a kiss on the cheek, when she came to the
door of her house and called her—“Uranita! Come, I have a
surprise for you, darling!”—after the girl climbed down from
the school bus. Urania goes into her house, kisses the lady—
she’s wearing a blue tulle dress, high-heeled shoes, enough
makeup to go to a dance, a pearl necklace, jewels on her
hands—opens the box wrapped in gift paper and tied with a
pink ribbon. She looks at the luxurious chocolates, impatient
to try them but not daring to—wouldn’t that be bad manners? —when the car stops on the street, very near the house.
The lady gives a start, the strange kind of movement horses
make suddenly, as if hearing a mysterious order. She has
turned pale and her voice is urgent: “You have to go.” The
hand resting on her shoulder twitches, clutches at her, pushes
her toward the entrance. When she obediently picks up her
book bag and is about to leave, the door opens wide: the overwhelming figure of the gentleman in a dark suit, starched
white cuffs and gold cuff links projecting from the sleeves of
his jacket, blocks her way. A gentleman who wears dark glasses
and is everywhere, including her memory. She stands paralyzed, openmouthed, looking, looking. His Excellency gives
her a reassuring smile.

“And who is this?”

“Uranita, Agustin Cabral’s daughter,” replies the lady of
the house. “She’s just leaving.”

And, in fact, Urania leaves without even saying goodbye
because she is struck dumb. She crosses the street, goes into
her house, climbs the stairs, and from her bedroom she peers
through the curtains, waiting, waiting for the President to

58
come out of the house across the way.

“And your daughter was so naive she didn’t even wonder
what the Father of the Nation was doing there when Don
Froilan wasn’t home.” Her father, calm now, listens, or seems
to listen, not taking his eyes off her. “So naive that when you
came home from Congress, I ran to tell you about it. I saw the
President, Papa! He came to visit Don Froilan’s wife, Papa!
What a look you had on your face!”

The narrow little eyes of the invalid want to open wide,
want to be round.

“My dear, there are things you can’t know, can’t understand yet. ’m here to know them for you, to protect you. I
love you more than anything in the world. Don’t ask me why,
but you have to forget about this. You weren’t at Froilan’s
house. You didn’t see his wife. And certainly, certainly not the
person you dreamed you saw. For your own good, sweetheart.
And mine. Don’t repeat it, don’t tell anybody about it. You
promise? Never? Not anybody? You swear?”

“I swore,” says Urania. “But not even that was enough to
make me suspect anything. Not even when you threatened the
servants that if they repeated the girl’s fairy tale they would lose
their jobs. That’s how innocent I was. By the time I discovered
why the Generalissimo paid visits to their wives, ministers
could no longer do what Henriquez Urefia did. Like Don
Froilan, they had to resign themselves to wearing horns. And
gain something from it since they had no alternative. Did you?
Did the Chief visit my mother? Before I was born? When I was
too little to remember? He visited them when the wives were
beautiful. My mother was beautiful, wasn’t she? I don’t remember him coming here, but he might have before I was_
born. What did my mother do? Did she accept it? Did she feel
happy, proud of the honor? That was the norm, wasn’t it?
Good Dominican women were grateful when the Chief
deigned to fuck them. You think that’s vulgar? But that was the
verb your beloved Chief used.”

Yes, that one. Urania knows, she has read it in her extensive

59
library on the Era. At night, after a few glasses of Carlos I Spanish brandy, Trujillo, so careful, refined, elegant in his speech—a
snake charmer when he set his mind to it—would suddenly
~ come out with the filthiest words, talk the way they talk on a
sugar plantation, in the bateys, among the stevedores on the
Ozama, in the stadiums or brothels, talk the way men talk when
they need to feel more macho than they really are. At times the
Chief could be savagely vulgar, repeating the harsh curses of his
youth, when he was a plantation overseer in San Cristdbal or a
guard in the constabulary. His courtiers celebrated them as enthusiastically as the speeches written for him by Senator Cabral
or the Constitutional Sot. He even boasted of the “cunts he had
fucked,” something his courtiers also celebrated even when that
could make them potential enemies of Dofia Maria Martinez,
the Bountiful First Lady, and even when those cunts were their
wives, sisters, mothers, or daughters. It wasn’t an exaggeration
of an overheated Dominican imagination, uncontrollably
heightening virtues and vices and embellishing real anecdotes
until they became fantasies. Some stories were invented, enhanced, colored by this fierce vocation of her compatriots. But
the story of Barahona had to be true. Urania hadn’t read it, she
had heard it (feeling nauseated), told by someone who was always close, very close, to the Benefactor.

“The Constitutional Sot, Papa. Yes, Senator Henry Chirinos, the Judas who betrayed you. I heard it from his own filthy
mouth. Are you surprised I was with him? As an official of the
World Bank I couldn’t avoid it. The director asked me to represent him at the reception given by our ambassador. I mean,
the ambassador of President Balaguer. Of the democratic civilian government of President Balaguer. Chirinos made out better than you did, Papa. He got you out of the way, he never fell
into disfavor with Trujillo, and in the end he changed direction
and adjusted to democracy even though he had been as much
of a Trujillista as you. There he was, in Washington, uglier
than ever, puffed up like a toad, tending to his guests and
drinking like a sponge. Allowing himself the luxury of enter
60
taining his companions with anecdotes about the Truyillo Era.
He of all people!”

The invalid has closed his eyes. Has he fallen asleep? His
head rests against the back of the chair and his wrinkled, empty
mouth hangs open. He looks thinner and more vulnerable this
way; through his bathrobe, she catches a glimpse of his hairless
chest, the white skin and prominent bones. His breathing 1s
regular. She notices only now that her father wears no socks;
his insteps and ankles are those of a child.

He hasn’t recognized her. How could he have imagined
that this official of the World Bank, who has given him the director’s greetings in English, is the daughter of Egghead
Cabral, his former colleague and crony? Urania manages to
keep her distance from the ambassador after the greeting demanded by protocol, exchanging banalities with people who
are obliged to be there, as she is, because of their positions. After a time, she prepares to leave. She approaches the circle listening to the ambassador of the democratic country, but what
he is saying stops her cold. Ashen, spotted skin, the maw of an
apoplectic beast, a triple chin, his elephantine belly about to
burst out of the tight blue suit with its fancy vest and red tie,
Ambassador Chirinos says it happened in Barahona, toward
the end, when Trujillo, in one of those acts of bravado he was
so fond of, announced that in order to set an example and activate Dominican democracy, he, who was retired from government (he had set up his brother Héctor Bienvenido,
nicknamed Blacky, as puppet president) would declare his candidacy not for the presidency but for an obscure provincial
governorship. And as an opposition candidate!

The ambassador of the democratic country snorts, takes a
breath, observes the effect of his words with tiny eyes that are
too close together. “Think of it, ladies and gentlemen,” he says
ironically: “Trujillo, a candidate opposed to his own regime!”
He smiles and continues, explaining that in the election campaign, Don Froilan Arala, one of the Generalissimo’s righthand men, delivered a speech urging the Chief to

61
declare not for the governorship but for what he still was in the
hearts of the Dominican people: President of the Republic. Everyone thought Don Froilan was following the Chief’s instructions. Not so. Or, at least—Ambassador Chirinos empties his
glass of whiskey with a malicious glint in his eyes—not so that
night, for it might also be true that Don Froilan had done as the
Chief ordered and the Chief changed his mind and decided to
go on with the farce for a few more days. He would do that
sometimes, even if it made his most talented collaborators look
ridiculous. Don Froilan Arala’s head might display a pair of
baroque horns, but it also boasted exceptional brains. The Chief
penalized him for his hagiographic speech as he usually did: by
humiliating him where it hurt most, in his honor as a man.

All of the local elite were at the reception given for the
Chief by the leaders of the Dominican Party of Barahona. They
danced and drank. Suddenly, when it was very late, the Chief,
feeling very good, before a huge audience composed exclusively of men—mulitary from the local garrison, ministers, senators, and deputies who were accompanying him on the
campaign tour, governors, political leaders—whom he had
been regaling with recollections of his first campaign tour three
decades earlier, and adopting that sentimental, nostalgic look
he put on suddenly at the end of parties, as if succumbing to an
attack of weakness, exclaimed:

“I have been a well-loved man. A man who has held in his
arms the most beautiful women in this country. They have
given me the energy to go on. Without them, I never could
have done what I did.” (He raised his glass to the light, examined the liquid, confirmed its transparency, the sharpness of its
color.) “Do you know which was the best of all the cunts I
fucked?” (“Forgive me, my friends, for the vulgarity,” the
diplomat apologized, “'m quoting Trujillo exactly.”) (He
paused again, inhaled the bouquet of his glass of brandy. The
silvery head looked for and found, in the circle of gentlemen
listening to him, the fat, livid face of the minister. And he concluded:) “Froilan’s wife!”

62
Urania grimaces in disgust, as she had on the night when
she heard Ambassador Chirinos add that Don Froilén had
smiled heroically, laughed, celebrated with the others the
Chief’s witticism. “White as a sheet, not fainting, not falling
down with a heart attack,” declared the diplomat.

“How was it possible, Papa? How could a man like Froilan
Arala, cultured, educated, intelligent, accept that? What did he
do to all of you? What did he give you that turned Don
Froilan, Chirinos, Manuel Alfonso, you, all his right- and lefthand men, into filthy rags?”

You don’t understand, Urania, though there are many
things about the Era that you’ve come to understand; at first,
some of them seemed impenetrable, but after reading, listening, investigating, thinking, you’ve come to understand how
so many millions of people, crushed by propaganda and lack of
information, brutalized by indoctrination and isolation, deprived of free will and even curiosity by fear and the habit of
servility and obsequiousness, could worship Truyillo. Not
merely fear him but love him, as children eventually love authoritarian parents, convincing themselves that the whippings
and beatings are for their own good. But what you’ve never
understood is how the best-educated Dominicans, the intellectuals of the country, the lawyers, doctors, engineers, often
graduates of very good universities in the United States or
Europe, sensitive, cultivated men of experience, wide reading,
ideas, presumably possessing a highly developed sense of the
ridiculous, men of feeling and scruples, could allow themselves
to be as savagely abused (they all were, at one time or another)
as Don Froilan Arala was that night in Barahona.

“Too bad you can’t speak,” she repeats, returning to the
present. “We'd try to understand it, together. What made Don
Froilén maintain a slavish loyalty to Trujillo? He was loyal to
the end, like you. He didn’t take part in the conspiracy, and
neither did you. He went on licking the hand of the Chief who
boasted in Barahona that he had fucked his wife. The Chief
who kept him traveling through South America as Chancellor

63
of the Republic, visiting governments from Buenos Aires to
Caracas, from Caracas to Rio or Brasilia, from Brasilia to Montevideo, from Montevideo to Caracas, just so he could go on
fucking our beautiful neighbor in peace.”

It is an image that has pursued Urania for a long time, one
that makes her laugh and makes her indignant. The image of
the Era’s Minister of Foreign Affairs getting in and out of
planes, traveling to South American capitals, obeying the
peremptory orders that waited for him at every airport so he
would continue his hysterical journey, pestering governments
for inane reasons. Just to keep him from returning to Ciudad
Trujillo while the Chief was screwing his wife. Crassweller
himself, the best-known biographer of Trujillo, mentioned it.
So everybody knew, including Don Froildn.

“Was it worth it, Papa? Was it for the illusion that you
were wielding power? Sometimes I think it wasn’t, that success
was secondary. That you, Arala, Pichardo, Chirinos, Alvarez
Pina, Manuel Alfonso, really liked getting dirty. That Truyillo
pulled a vocation for masochism up from the bottom of your
souls, that you were people who needed to be spat on and mistreated and debased in order to be fulfilled.”

The invalid looks at her without blinking, without moving
his lips or the small hands resting on his knees. Like a mummy,
a small embalmed man, a wax doll. His robe is faded, threadbare in places. It must be very old, bought ten or fifteen years
ago. There’s a knock on the door. She says “Come in,” and the
nurse appears, carrying a plate with pieces of mango cut into
half-moon shapes and some mashed apple or banana.

“At midmorning I always give him some fruit,” she explains from the door. “The doctor says his stomach shouldn’t
be empty for too long. Since he barely eats, I have to feed him
three or four times a day. At night, just some broth. May I?”

“Yes, come in.”

Urania looks at her father and his eyes remain on her; they
don’t move to look at the nurse even when she sits in front of

him and begins to give him little spoonfuls of food.
64
“Where are his dentures?”

“We had to take them out. He’s gotten so thin they made
his gums bleed. For what he eats, broth, cut-up fruit, purees,
things from the blender, he doesn’t need them.”

For a long while they are silent. When the invalid finishes
swallowing, the nurse brings the spoon up to his lips and waits
patiently for the old man to open his mouth. Then, delicately,
she gives him the next mouthful. Does she always do this? Or
is her delicacy due to the presence of his daughter? No question. When she’s alone with him she must scold him and pinch
him, like nannies with babies who don’t talk yet, when their
mothers can’t see them.

“Give him a few mouthfals,” says the nurse. “He wants
you to. Isn’t that nght, Don Agustin? You want your daughter
_ to give you this nice food, don’t you? Yes, yes, he’d like that.
Give him a few mouthfuls while I go downstairs for his glass of
water. I forgot it.”

She places the half-empty plate in Urania’s hands, who accepts it mechanically, and she goes out, leaving the door open.
_ After hesitating a few moments, Urania brings the spoon that
holds a slice of mango up to his mouth. The invalid, who has
still not taken his eyes off her, closes his mouth, clenching his
lips like a difficult child.

65
“Aren’t you going up to see him?” the nurse says at last.
, Urania knows the question has been struggling to
[= pass the woman’s lips ever since she came into the little house on César Nicolas Penson, but instead of asking the
nurse to take her to Sefior Cabral’s room, she went to the
kitchen and fixed herself some coffee. She has been sipping it
for the past ten minutes.

“First Pll finish my breakfast,” she answers, not smiling,
and the nurse lowers her eyes in confusion. “I need strength to
climb those stairs.”

“I know there was trouble between you and him, I heard
something about it,” the woman apologizes, not knowing
what to do with her hands. “I was just asking. I already gave
him his breakfast and shaved him. He always wakes up very
early.”

Urania nods. She feels calm and confident now. Again she
examines the decay around her. The paint on the walls has deteriorated, and the tabletop, the sink, the cupboard, everything
looks smaller and misaligned. Was it the same furniture? She
didn’t recognize anything.

“Does anyone come to visit him? Anybody in the family, I
mean.”

“Sefiora Adelina’s daughters, Sefiora Lucindita and Sefiora
Manolita, always come about noon.” The woman—tall, no
longer young, wearing slacks under her white uniform—stands
in the kitchen doorway and does not hide her discomfort.
“Your aunt used to come every day. But since she broke her
hip, she doesn’t go out anymore.”

Aunt Adelina was a good deal younger than her father, she
couldn’t be more than seventy-five. So she broke her hip. Was

 

52
she still so devout? She took communion every day, back then.

“Is he in his bedroom?” Urania drinks the last of her coffee. “Well, where else would he be?. No, don’t come up with
me.”

She climbs the staircase with the discolored railing where,
she remembers, pots filled with flowers used to hang, and she
can’t shake the feeling that the house has shrunk. When she
reaches the upper floor, she notices the chipped tiles, some of
them loose. This had been a modern house, comfortable, furnished with taste; it has fallen on hard times, it’s a hovel compared to the houses and condominiums she saw the night
before in Bella Vista. She stops at the first door—this used to be
his room—and before she goes in, she knocks a couple of times.

She is greeted by intense light that pours through the
wide-open window. The glare blinds her for a few seconds;
then she begins to make out the bed covered by a gray
spread, the old bureau with its oval mirror, the photographs
on the walls—how did he get hold of her graduation picture
from Harvard? —and, finally, in the old leather chair with its
broad back and arms, an old man in blue pajamas and slippers. He looks dwarfed by the chair. He has grown wrinkled
_ and smaller, just like the house. She is distracted by a white
object at her father’s feet, a small chamber pot, half filled with
urine. “

Back then his hair was black except for some distinguished
gray at his temples; now the sparse hairs on his bald head are
yellowish, dirty. His eyes were large, sure of themselves, masters of the world (when he wasn’t near the Chief); but these
two slits staring at her are tiny, beady, frightened. He had teeth
and now he doesn’t; he can’t be wearing his dentures (she paid
the bill for them a few years ago), because his lips have collapsed and his cheeks are so sunken they almost touch. He has
shriveled, his feet barely touch the floor. To look at him she
used to have to raise her head, stretch her neck; now, if he were
to stand up, he would reach her shoulder.

“Its Urania,” she murmurs, approaching him. She sits on

53
the bed, a meter from her father. “Do you remember that you
have a daughter?”

There is internal agitation in the old man, movements of
the pale bony hands with tapered fingers that rest on his legs.
But the narrow little eyes, although they don’t move away
from Urania, remain unexpressive.

“I don’t recognize you either,” Urania whispers. “I don’t
know why I came or what I’m doing here.”

The old man has begun to move his head, up and down,
down and up. His throat emits a long, harsh, strangled moan,
like a lugubrious song. But in a few moments he is calm again,
his eyes still fixed on her.

“The house used to be full of books.” Urania glances at the
bare walls. “What happened to them? Of course, you can’t read
anymore. Did you have time to read back then? I don’t remember ever seeing you read. You were a busy man. I’m busy too
now, maybe even more than you in those days. Ten, twelve
hours in the office or visiting clients. But I make time to read a
little every day. Early in the morning, watching the sun come up
behind the Manhattan skyscrapers, or late at night, looking at
the lights in those glass beehives. I really like it. On Sundays I
read for three or four hours, after Meet the Press. The advantage
of being single, Papa. You knew that, didn’t you? Your hittle girl
was left behind to dress the saints. That’s what you used to say
about unmarried women: ‘What a failure! She never caught a
husband!’ Neither did I, Papa. Or rather, I didn’t want to. I had
offers. At the university. At the World Bank. At the office. Just
think, a boyfriend may still turn up. At the age of forty-nine! It
isn’t so terrible being an old maid. For one thing, I have time to
read instead of taking care of a husband and children.”

He seems to understand, to be so interested he doesn’t
dare move a muscle in case he interrupts her. He sits very still,
his narrow chest rising and falling rhythmically, his tiny eyes
focused on her lips. Outside an occasional car passes, and footsteps, voices, snatches of conversation approach, nise, fall, and
are lost in the distance.

54
“My apartment in Manhattan is full of books,” Urania continues. “Like this house when I was a girl. Law, economy, history. But in my bedroom, only Dominican books.
Testimonies, essays, memoirs, lots of histories. Can you guess
the period? The Trujillo Era, what else? The most important
thing that happened to us in five hundred years. You used to
say that with so much conviction. It’s true, Papa. During those
thirty-one years, all the evil we had carried with us since the
Conquest became crystallized. You’re in some of those books,
an important figure. Minister of Foreign Affairs, senator, president of the Dominican Party. Is there anything you weren’t,
Papa? Pve become an expert on Trujillo. Instead of playing
bridge or golf, or riding horses, or going to the opera, my
hobby has been finding out what happened during those years.
Its a shame we can’t have a conversation. You could clarify so
many things for me, you lived them arm in arm with your
beloved Chief, who repaid your loyalty so shabbily. For instance, I would have liked for you to tell me if His Excellency
also took my mother to bed.”

She sees that the old man is shaken. His fragile, shrunken
body has given a start in the chair. Urania moves her head
closer and observes him. Is it a false impression? He seems to
be listening, making an effort to understand what she is saying.

“Did you allow it? Resign yourself to it? Use it to further
your career?”

Urania takes a deep breath. She examines the room. There
are two photographs in silver frames on the night table. Her
first communion, the year her mother died. Perhaps she left
this world with a vision of her little girl enveloped in the tulle
of that beautiful dress, with that angelic look. The other photo
is of her mother: young, black hair parted in the middle, eyebrows tweezed, eyes melancholy and dreamy. It’s an old, yellowing photograph, slightly creased. She goes to the night
table, raises the photograph to her lips, and kisses it.

She hears a car braking at the front door. Her heart skips a
beat; without moving from her place, she can see, through the

55
curtains, the sparkling chrome, the gleaming body, the flashing
brilliance of the luxurious automobile. She hears footsteps, the
doorbell chimes two or three times, and—hypnotized, petrified, not moving—she hears the maid opening the door. She
hears but doesn’t understand the brief conversation at the foot
of the stairs. Her madly beating heart is about to explode. Taps
on the door. An Indian girl, wearing a maid’s uniform, her expression terrified, looks in the half-opened door:

“The President has come to visit you, sefiora. The Generalissimo, senora!”

“Tell him I’m sorry but I can’t receive him. Tell him Sefiora
de Cabral does not receive visitors when Agustin is not at
home. Go on, tell him.”

The girl’s footsteps move away, timid, indecisive, going
down the staircase with the railing where flowerpots hang,
ablaze with geraniums. Urania replaces her mother’s photograph on the nightstand and returns to the corner of the bed.
Trapped in the chair, her father looks at her in alarm.

“That’s what the Chief did to his Minister of Education,
early in his government, and you know all about it, Papa.
What he did to the young scholar, Don Pedro Henriquez
Urefia, a refined, genial man. He came to see his wife while
Don Pedro was at work. She was brave enough to tell him she
didn’t receive visitors when her husband wasn’t home. At the
beginning of the Era it was still possible for a woman to refuse
to receive the Chief. When she told him what had happened,
Don Pedro resigned, left the country, and never set foot on
this island again. Which is why he became so famous as a ~
teacher, a historian, a critic, a philologist, in Mexico, Argentina,
and Spain. Lucky for him the Chief wanted to go to bed with
his wife. In those early days, a minister could resign and not
have an accident, or fall off a cliff, or be stabbed by a madman,
or eaten by sharks. He did the right thing, don’t you agree?
His action saved him from becoming what you became, Papa.
Would you have done the same thing or looked away? Like
your hated good friend, your despised dear colleague, our

56
neighbor Don Froilan. Do you remember, Papa?”

The old man begins to tremble and moan that macabre
song. Urania waits until he settles down. Don Froilan! He
would whisper in the living room, on the terrace or in the garden with her father, whom he came to see several times a day
during the periods when they were allies in the internecine
struggles among the Trujillista factions, battles the Benefactor
encouraged in order to neutralize his collaborators by keeping
them busy protecting their backs from the knives of enemies
who were, in public, their friends, brothers, and fellow believers. Don Froildn lived in the house across the way; on its tiled
roof there are, at this very moment, a row of half a dozen pigeons standing at attention. Urania goes to the window. It
hasn’t changed much either, the house of that powerful man
who was also a minister, senator, intendant, chancellor, ambassador, everything one could be during those years. Even Minister of Foreign Affairs, in May 1961, when the great events
took place. :

The house is still painted gray and white, but it too has
grown smaller. An extension of four or five meters has been
built on, out of harmony with the projecting pointed arch at
the entrance in the style of a Gothic castle, where she often
saw, on her way home from school in the afternoons, the elegant figure of Don Froilan’s wife. As soon as the woman saw
her she would call: “Urania, Uranita! Come here, let me look
at you, darling. What eyes, my girl! You're as pretty as your
mother, Uranita.” She would stroke her hair with carefully
manicured hands, the long nails painted a deep red. Urania
would feel so dreamy when those fingers moved through her
hair and caressed her scalp. Eugenia? Laura? Did she have a
flower name? Magnolia? She’s forgotten. But not her face, her
snowy skin, silken eyes, regal figure. She always seemed to be
dressed for a party. Urania loved her because she was so affectionate, because she gave her gifts and took her to the Country
Club to swim in the pool, and, above all, because she had been
her mother’s friend. She imagined that if she hadn’t gone to

57
heaven, her mother would be as beautiful and aristocratic as
Don Froilan’s wife. There was nothing attractive about him,
however. Short, bald, fat: no woman would have looked at
him twice. Was it the need to find a husband or self-interest
that made her marry him?

This is what she asks herself in bewilderment as she opens
the box of chocolates, wrapped in metallic paper, that the lady
has given her, with a kiss on the cheek, when she came to the
door of her house and called her—“Uranita! Come, I have a
surprise for you, darling!”—after the girl climbed down from
the school bus. Urania goes into her house, kisses the lady—
she’s wearing a blue tulle dress, high-heeled shoes, enough
makeup to go to a dance, a pearl necklace, jewels on her
hands—opens the box wrapped in gift paper and tied with a
pink ribbon. She looks at the luxurious chocolates, impatient
to try them but not daring to—wouldn’t that be bad manners? —when the car stops on the street, very near the house.
The lady gives a start, the strange kind of movement horses
make suddenly, as if hearing a mysterious order. She has
turned pale and her voice is urgent: “You have to go.” The
hand resting on her shoulder twitches, clutches at her, pushes
her toward the entrance. When she obediently picks up her
book bag and is about to leave, the door opens wide: the overwhelming figure of the gentleman in a dark suit, starched
white cuffs and gold cuff links projecting from the sleeves of
his jacket, blocks her way. A gentleman who wears dark glasses
and is everywhere, including her memory. She stands paralyzed, openmouthed, looking, looking. His Excellency gives
her a reassuring smile.

“And who is this?”

“Uranita, Agustin Cabral’s daughter,” replies the lady of
the house. “She’s just leaving.”

And, in fact, Urania leaves without even saying goodbye
because she is struck dumb. She crosses the street, goes into
her house, climbs the stairs, and from her bedroom she peers
through the curtains, waiting, waiting for the President to

58
come out of the house across the way.

“And your daughter was so naive she didn’t even wonder
what the Father of the Nation was doing there when Don
Froilan wasn’t home.” Her father, calm now, listens, or seems
to listen, not taking his eyes off her. “So naive that when you
came home from Congress, I ran to tell you about it. I saw the
President, Papa! He came to visit Don Froilan’s wife, Papa!
What a look you had on your face!”

The narrow little eyes of the invalid want to open wide,
want to be round.

“My dear, there are things you can’t know, can’t understand yet. ’m here to know them for you, to protect you. I
love you more than anything in the world. Don’t ask me why,
but you have to forget about this. You weren’t at Froilan’s
house. You didn’t see his wife. And certainly, certainly not the
person you dreamed you saw. For your own good, sweetheart.
And mine. Don’t repeat it, don’t tell anybody about it. You
promise? Never? Not anybody? You swear?”

“I swore,” says Urania. “But not even that was enough to
make me suspect anything. Not even when you threatened the
servants that if they repeated the girl’s fairy tale they would lose
their jobs. That’s how innocent I was. By the time I discovered
why the Generalissimo paid visits to their wives, ministers
could no longer do what Henriquez Urefia did. Like Don
Froilan, they had to resign themselves to wearing horns. And
gain something from it since they had no alternative. Did you?
Did the Chief visit my mother? Before I was born? When I was
too little to remember? He visited them when the wives were
beautiful. My mother was beautiful, wasn’t she? I don’t remember him coming here, but he might have before I was_
born. What did my mother do? Did she accept it? Did she feel
happy, proud of the honor? That was the norm, wasn’t it?
Good Dominican women were grateful when the Chief
deigned to fuck them. You think that’s vulgar? But that was the
verb your beloved Chief used.”

Yes, that one. Urania knows, she has read it in her extensive

59
library on the Era. At night, after a few glasses of Carlos I Spanish brandy, Trujillo, so careful, refined, elegant in his speech—a
snake charmer when he set his mind to it—would suddenly
~ come out with the filthiest words, talk the way they talk on a
sugar plantation, in the bateys, among the stevedores on the
Ozama, in the stadiums or brothels, talk the way men talk when
they need to feel more macho than they really are. At times the
Chief could be savagely vulgar, repeating the harsh curses of his
youth, when he was a plantation overseer in San Cristdbal or a
guard in the constabulary. His courtiers celebrated them as enthusiastically as the speeches written for him by Senator Cabral
or the Constitutional Sot. He even boasted of the “cunts he had
fucked,” something his courtiers also celebrated even when that
could make them potential enemies of Dofia Maria Martinez,
the Bountiful First Lady, and even when those cunts were their
wives, sisters, mothers, or daughters. It wasn’t an exaggeration
of an overheated Dominican imagination, uncontrollably
heightening virtues and vices and embellishing real anecdotes
until they became fantasies. Some stories were invented, enhanced, colored by this fierce vocation of her compatriots. But
the story of Barahona had to be true. Urania hadn’t read it, she
had heard it (feeling nauseated), told by someone who was always close, very close, to the Benefactor.

“The Constitutional Sot, Papa. Yes, Senator Henry Chirinos, the Judas who betrayed you. I heard it from his own filthy
mouth. Are you surprised I was with him? As an official of the
World Bank I couldn’t avoid it. The director asked me to represent him at the reception given by our ambassador. I mean,
the ambassador of President Balaguer. Of the democratic civilian government of President Balaguer. Chirinos made out better than you did, Papa. He got you out of the way, he never fell
into disfavor with Trujillo, and in the end he changed direction
and adjusted to democracy even though he had been as much
of a Trujillista as you. There he was, in Washington, uglier
than ever, puffed up like a toad, tending to his guests and
drinking like a sponge. Allowing himself the luxury of enter
60
taining his companions with anecdotes about the Truyillo Era.
He of all people!”

The invalid has closed his eyes. Has he fallen asleep? His
head rests against the back of the chair and his wrinkled, empty
mouth hangs open. He looks thinner and more vulnerable this
way; through his bathrobe, she catches a glimpse of his hairless
chest, the white skin and prominent bones. His breathing 1s
regular. She notices only now that her father wears no socks;
his insteps and ankles are those of a child.

He hasn’t recognized her. How could he have imagined
that this official of the World Bank, who has given him the director’s greetings in English, is the daughter of Egghead
Cabral, his former colleague and crony? Urania manages to
keep her distance from the ambassador after the greeting demanded by protocol, exchanging banalities with people who
are obliged to be there, as she is, because of their positions. After a time, she prepares to leave. She approaches the circle listening to the ambassador of the democratic country, but what
he is saying stops her cold. Ashen, spotted skin, the maw of an
apoplectic beast, a triple chin, his elephantine belly about to
burst out of the tight blue suit with its fancy vest and red tie,
Ambassador Chirinos says it happened in Barahona, toward
the end, when Trujillo, in one of those acts of bravado he was
so fond of, announced that in order to set an example and activate Dominican democracy, he, who was retired from government (he had set up his brother Héctor Bienvenido,
nicknamed Blacky, as puppet president) would declare his candidacy not for the presidency but for an obscure provincial
governorship. And as an opposition candidate!

The ambassador of the democratic country snorts, takes a
breath, observes the effect of his words with tiny eyes that are
too close together. “Think of it, ladies and gentlemen,” he says
ironically: “Trujillo, a candidate opposed to his own regime!”
He smiles and continues, explaining that in the election campaign, Don Froilan Arala, one of the Generalissimo’s righthand men, delivered a speech urging the Chief to

61
declare not for the governorship but for what he still was in the
hearts of the Dominican people: President of the Republic. Everyone thought Don Froilan was following the Chief’s instructions. Not so. Or, at least—Ambassador Chirinos empties his
glass of whiskey with a malicious glint in his eyes—not so that
night, for it might also be true that Don Froilan had done as the
Chief ordered and the Chief changed his mind and decided to
go on with the farce for a few more days. He would do that
sometimes, even if it made his most talented collaborators look
ridiculous. Don Froilan Arala’s head might display a pair of
baroque horns, but it also boasted exceptional brains. The Chief
penalized him for his hagiographic speech as he usually did: by
humiliating him where it hurt most, in his honor as a man.

All of the local elite were at the reception given for the
Chief by the leaders of the Dominican Party of Barahona. They
danced and drank. Suddenly, when it was very late, the Chief,
feeling very good, before a huge audience composed exclusively of men—mulitary from the local garrison, ministers, senators, and deputies who were accompanying him on the
campaign tour, governors, political leaders—whom he had
been regaling with recollections of his first campaign tour three
decades earlier, and adopting that sentimental, nostalgic look
he put on suddenly at the end of parties, as if succumbing to an
attack of weakness, exclaimed:

“I have been a well-loved man. A man who has held in his
arms the most beautiful women in this country. They have
given me the energy to go on. Without them, I never could
have done what I did.” (He raised his glass to the light, examined the liquid, confirmed its transparency, the sharpness of its
color.) “Do you know which was the best of all the cunts I
fucked?” (“Forgive me, my friends, for the vulgarity,” the
diplomat apologized, “'m quoting Trujillo exactly.”) (He
paused again, inhaled the bouquet of his glass of brandy. The
silvery head looked for and found, in the circle of gentlemen
listening to him, the fat, livid face of the minister. And he concluded:) “Froilan’s wife!”

62
Urania grimaces in disgust, as she had on the night when
she heard Ambassador Chirinos add that Don Froilén had
smiled heroically, laughed, celebrated with the others the
Chief’s witticism. “White as a sheet, not fainting, not falling
down with a heart attack,” declared the diplomat.

“How was it possible, Papa? How could a man like Froilan
Arala, cultured, educated, intelligent, accept that? What did he
do to all of you? What did he give you that turned Don
Froilan, Chirinos, Manuel Alfonso, you, all his right- and lefthand men, into filthy rags?”

You don’t understand, Urania, though there are many
things about the Era that you’ve come to understand; at first,
some of them seemed impenetrable, but after reading, listening, investigating, thinking, you’ve come to understand how
so many millions of people, crushed by propaganda and lack of
information, brutalized by indoctrination and isolation, deprived of free will and even curiosity by fear and the habit of
servility and obsequiousness, could worship Truyillo. Not
merely fear him but love him, as children eventually love authoritarian parents, convincing themselves that the whippings
and beatings are for their own good. But what you’ve never
understood is how the best-educated Dominicans, the intellectuals of the country, the lawyers, doctors, engineers, often
graduates of very good universities in the United States or
Europe, sensitive, cultivated men of experience, wide reading,
ideas, presumably possessing a highly developed sense of the
ridiculous, men of feeling and scruples, could allow themselves
to be as savagely abused (they all were, at one time or another)
as Don Froilan Arala was that night in Barahona.

“Too bad you can’t speak,” she repeats, returning to the
present. “We'd try to understand it, together. What made Don
Froilén maintain a slavish loyalty to Trujillo? He was loyal to
the end, like you. He didn’t take part in the conspiracy, and
neither did you. He went on licking the hand of the Chief who
boasted in Barahona that he had fucked his wife. The Chief
who kept him traveling through South America as Chancellor

63
of the Republic, visiting governments from Buenos Aires to
Caracas, from Caracas to Rio or Brasilia, from Brasilia to Montevideo, from Montevideo to Caracas, just so he could go on
fucking our beautiful neighbor in peace.”

It is an image that has pursued Urania for a long time, one
that makes her laugh and makes her indignant. The image of
the Era’s Minister of Foreign Affairs getting in and out of
planes, traveling to South American capitals, obeying the
peremptory orders that waited for him at every airport so he
would continue his hysterical journey, pestering governments
for inane reasons. Just to keep him from returning to Ciudad
Trujillo while the Chief was screwing his wife. Crassweller
himself, the best-known biographer of Trujillo, mentioned it.
So everybody knew, including Don Froildn.

“Was it worth it, Papa? Was it for the illusion that you
were wielding power? Sometimes I think it wasn’t, that success
was secondary. That you, Arala, Pichardo, Chirinos, Alvarez
Pina, Manuel Alfonso, really liked getting dirty. That Truyillo
pulled a vocation for masochism up from the bottom of your
souls, that you were people who needed to be spat on and mistreated and debased in order to be fulfilled.”

The invalid looks at her without blinking, without moving
his lips or the small hands resting on his knees. Like a mummy,
a small embalmed man, a wax doll. His robe is faded, threadbare in places. It must be very old, bought ten or fifteen years
ago. There’s a knock on the door. She says “Come in,” and the
nurse appears, carrying a plate with pieces of mango cut into
half-moon shapes and some mashed apple or banana.

“At midmorning I always give him some fruit,” she explains from the door. “The doctor says his stomach shouldn’t
be empty for too long. Since he barely eats, I have to feed him
three or four times a day. At night, just some broth. May I?”

“Yes, come in.”

Urania looks at her father and his eyes remain on her; they
don’t move to look at the nurse even when she sits in front of

him and begins to give him little spoonfuls of food.
64
“Where are his dentures?”

“We had to take them out. He’s gotten so thin they made
his gums bleed. For what he eats, broth, cut-up fruit, purees,
things from the blender, he doesn’t need them.”

For a long while they are silent. When the invalid finishes
swallowing, the nurse brings the spoon up to his lips and waits
patiently for the old man to open his mouth. Then, delicately,
she gives him the next mouthful. Does she always do this? Or
is her delicacy due to the presence of his daughter? No question. When she’s alone with him she must scold him and pinch
him, like nannies with babies who don’t talk yet, when their
mothers can’t see them.

“Give him a few mouthfals,” says the nurse. “He wants
you to. Isn’t that nght, Don Agustin? You want your daughter
_ to give you this nice food, don’t you? Yes, yes, he’d like that.
Give him a few mouthfuls while I go downstairs for his glass of
water. I forgot it.”

She places the half-empty plate in Urania’s hands, who accepts it mechanically, and she goes out, leaving the door open.
_ After hesitating a few moments, Urania brings the spoon that
holds a slice of mango up to his mouth. The invalid, who has
still not taken his eyes off her, closes his mouth, clenching his
lips like a difficult child.

65
